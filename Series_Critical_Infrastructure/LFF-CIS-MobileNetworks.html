<h1>Network Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#network-structure" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>In general, every telecommunications network conceptually consists of three parts, or planes (so called because they can be thought of as being, and often are, separate overlay networks):</p>
<p>The data plane (also user plane, bearer plane, or forwarding plane) carries the network’s users’ traffic, the actual payload.
The control plane carries control information (also known as signaling).
The management plane carries the operations and administration traffic required for network management. The management plane is sometimes considered a part of the control plane.</p>
<p>A  cellular network or mobile network is a communication network where the last link is wireless. The network is distributed over land areas called cells, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver, but more normally three cell sites or base transceiver stations. These base stations provide the cell with the network coverage which can be used for transmission of voice, data and others.</p>
</section>
<section id="structure-of-the-mobile-phone-cellular-network">
<h1>Structure of the mobile phone cellular network<a class="headerlink" href="#structure-of-the-mobile-phone-cellular-network" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>A simple view of the cellular mobile-radio network consists of the following:</p>
<p>A network of radio base stations forming the base station subsystem.
The core circuit switched network for handling voice calls and text
A packet switched network for handling mobile data
The public switched telephone network to connect subscribers to the wider telephony network
This network is the foundation of the GSM system network. There are many functions that are performed by this network in order to make sure customers get the desired service including mobility management, registration, call set-up, and handover.</p>
<p>Any phone connects to the network via an RBS (Radio Base Station) at a corner of the corresponding cell which in turn connects to the Mobile switching center (MSC). The MSC provides a connection to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The link from a phone to the RBS is called an uplink while the other way is termed downlink.</p>

<p>A broadband remote access server (BRAS, B-RAS or BBRAS) routes traffic to and from broadband remote access devices such as digital subscriber line access multiplexers (DSLAM) on an Internet service provider’s (ISP) network. BRAS can also be referred to as a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG).</p>
<p>The BRAS is also the interface to authentication, authorization and accounting systems (see RADIUS).</p>
<p>The Diameter base protocol provides authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services in 3G, IMS, and 4G networks for applications such as network access and data mobility. AAA protocols form the basis for service administration within the telecommunications industry, such as deciding which services a user can access, at what quality of service (QoS), and at what cost.</p>

<section id="ipoe">
<h2>IPoE<a class="headerlink" href="#ipoe" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Internet Protocol over Ethernet (IPoE) is a method of delivering an IP payload over an Ethernet-based access network or an access network using bridged Ethernet over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) without using PPPoE. It directly encapsulates the IP datagrams in Ethernet frames, using the standard RFC 894 encapsulation.</p>
<p>The use of IPoE addresses the disadvantage that PPP is unsuited for multicast delivery to multiple users. Typically, IPoE uses Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and Extensible Authentication Protocol to provide the same functionality as PPPoE, but in a less robust manner.</p>

<h1>NSS<a class="headerlink" href="#nss" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Network switching subsystem (NSS) (or GSM core network) is the component of a GSM system that carries out call switching and mobility management functions for mobile phones roaming on the network of base stations.</p>
<section id="msc">
<h2>MSC<a class="headerlink" href="#msc" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The mobile switching center (MSC) is the primary service delivery node for GSM/CDMA, responsible for routing voice calls and SMS as well as other services (such as conference calls, FAX and circuit switched data).</p>
<p>The MSC sets up and releases the end-to-end connection, handles mobility and hand-over requirements during the call and takes care of charging and real time prepaid account monitoring.</p>
<p>There are various different names for MSCs in different contexts which reflects their complex role in the network, all of these terms though could refer to the same MSC, but doing different things at different times.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The gateway MSC (G-MSC) is the MSC that determines which “visited MSC” (V-MSC) the subscriber who is being called is currently located at. It also interfaces with the PSTN. All mobile to mobile calls and PSTN to mobile calls are routed through a G-MSC. The term is only valid in the context of one call, since any MSC may provide both the gateway function and the visited MSC function. However, some manufacturers design dedicated high capacity MSCs which do not have any base station subsystems (BSS) connected to them. These MSCs will then be the gateway MSC for many of the calls they handle.</p></li>
<li><p>The visited MSC (V-MSC) is the MSC where a customer is currently located. The visitor location register (VLR) associated with this MSC will have the subscriber’s data in it.</p></li>
<li><p>The anchor MSC is the MSC from which a handover has been initiated. The target MSC is the MSC toward which a handover should take place.</p></li>

<section id="home-location-register-hlr">
<h2>Home location register (HLR)<a class="headerlink" href="#home-location-register-hlr" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The home location register (HLR) is a central database that contains details of each mobile phone subscriber that is authorized to use the GSM core network. There can be several logical, and physical, HLRs per public land mobile network (PLMN), though one international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI)/MSISDN pair can be associated with only one logical HLR (which can span several physical nodes) at a time.</p>
<p>The HLRs store details of every SIM card issued by the mobile phone operator. Each SIM has a unique identifier called an IMSI which is the primary key to each HLR record.</p>
<p>Another important item of data associated with the SIM are the MSISDNs, which are the telephone numbers used by mobile phones to make and receive calls. The primary MSISDN is the number used for making and receiving voice calls and SMS, but it is possible for a SIM to have other secondary MSISDNs associated with it for fax and data calls. Each MSISDN is also a primary key to the HLR record. The HLR data is stored for as long as a subscriber remains with the mobile phone operator.</p>
<p>Examples of other data stored in the HLR against an IMSI record is:</p>
<p>GSM services that the subscriber has requested or been given.
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) settings to allow the subscriber to access packet services.
Current location of subscriber (VLR and serving GPRS support node/SGSN).
Call divert settings applicable for each associated MSISDN.</p>
<p>The HLR connects to the following elements:</p>
<p>The G-MSC for handling incoming calls
The VLR for handling requests from mobile phones to attach to the network
The SMSC for handling incoming SMSs
The voice mail system for delivering notifications to the mobile phone that a message is waiting
The AuC for authentication and ciphering and exchange of data (triplets)</p>
</section>
<section id="authentication-center-auc">
<h2>Authentication center (AuC)<a class="headerlink" href="#authentication-center-auc" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The authentication center (AuC) is a function to authenticate each SIM card that attempts to connect to the GSM core network (typically when the phone is powered on). Once the authentication is successful, the HLR is allowed to manage the SIM and services described above. An encryption key is also generated that is subsequently used to encrypt all wireless communications (voice, SMS, etc.) between the mobile phone and the GSM core network.</p>
<p>If the authentication fails, then no services are possible from that particular combination of SIM card and mobile phone operator attempted. There is an additional form of identification check performed on the serial number of the mobile phone described in the EIR section below, but this is not relevant to the AuC processing.</p>
<p>Proper implementation of security in and around the AuC is a key part of an operator’s strategy to avoid SIM cloning.</p>

<h2>Visitor location register (VLR)<a class="headerlink" href="#visitor-location-register-vlr" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The Visitor Location Register (VLR) is a database of the MSs (Mobile Stations) that have roamed into the jurisdiction of the MSC (Mobile Switching Center) which it serves. Each main base station in the network is served by exactly one VLR (one BTS may be served by many MSCs in case of MSC in pool), hence a subscriber cannot be present in more than one VLR at a time.</p>
<p>Data stored include:</p>
<p>IMSI (the subscriber’s identity number).
Authentication data.
MSISDN (the subscriber’s phone number).
GSM services that the subscriber is allowed to access.
access point (GPRS) subscribed.
The HLR address of the subscriber.

<h2>Equipment identity register (EIR)<a class="headerlink" href="#equipment-identity-register-eir" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The equipment identity register is often integrated to the HLR. The EIR keeps a list of mobile phones (identified by their IMEI) which are to be banned from the network or monitored. This is designed to allow tracking of stolen mobile phones.</p>
<p>Billing center (BC)[edit]
The billing center is responsible for processing the toll tickets generated by the VLRs and HLRs and generating a bill for each subscriber. It is also responsible for generating billing data of roaming subscriber.</p>
<p>Multimedia messaging service center (MMSC)[edit]
The multimedia messaging service center supports the sending of multimedia messages (e.g., images, audio, video and their combinations) to (or from) MMS-enabled Handsets.</p>

The RNC connects to the Circuit Switched Core Network through Media Gateway (MGW) and to the SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) in the Packet Switched Core Network.</p>
