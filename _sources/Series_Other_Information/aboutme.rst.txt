Iâ€™m programmer and computer security enthusiast. This blog was started to document all the cool things I learn and to share it with the people who might find it useful and helpful. Also, to streamline things, make the process of pentesting clear Umm... sort of. I have converted the blog in to Sphinx, so if you want to collaborate, correct/ add / modify some content i.e add knowledge. Please submit a pull request. :)

Currently, I am trying to learn penetration testing using VulHub Machines, next in plan is to read tutorials on Cyberaces.org and enroll in OSCP.

Completed
---------

* Introduction to Cyber Security by FutureLearn.
* Over The Wire: Bandit, Leviathan, Narnia, Behemoth.

.. Todo :: Over the Wire, Other games,  Cryptopals, VulnHub Images, Exploit-exercises
