Cybersecurity in an Enterprise
******************************

This blog is about the Cybersecurity in an Enterprise. We would start with a simple concept of two people (Alice and Bob) starting a new company and building it to Micro (< 10 employees), Small (< 50 employees), Medium-sized (< 250 employees), larger company. We would walkthru scenarios where company is affected by security breaches, vulnerability assessments excercises. At each stage of the company, we would provide

* How the company can be made secure?
* What are the challenges faced by the administrators?
* How we can make things easy/automate for the administrators of the company.
  
Hopefully this will provide a general life-cycle of what happens and how things/security evolve at companies.

Nomenclature
============

There are few terms which would come across:

* Current Users        : Represents the number of people working in that company.
* Current Setup        : Represents the current IT Infrastructure the company has.
* Security Additions   : How we can improve the security of the current infrastructure?
* Operations Issues    : Any challenges for the IT Team managing the IT Infrastructure?
* Operations Additions : How we can improve the management of IT Infrastructure?

New Company
===========

Two friends Alice and Bob met up and decided to open a company called Fantastic Solutions. Alice loves Linux (Debian) and Bob loves Windows. So, let's see what they require at this current point of time?

Current Users 
-------------

2 Users

Current Setup
-------------

* Internet Connection
* Home Router with builtin Wi-Fi
* Two laptops (One Windows, One Linux)

Security Additions
------------------

Home Router with builtin Wi-Fi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
* WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)
* WPA2-Enterprise
* Hidden SSID (Service Set IDentifier)
* Home Router DNS Entry: No-Ads DNS Servers - free, global Domain Name System (DNS) resolution service, that you can use to block unwanted ads. Few examples are 

 * `Adguard DNS <https://adguard-dns.io/en/public-dns.html>`_
 * `OpenDNS <https://www.opendns.com/>`_

Micro Enterprise
================

The company started well and hired 8 more people (Let's say two who loves Linux, two who loves Mac and two who loves Windows)

Current Users
-------------
10 People

Current Setup
-------------

* New Company Setup Included
* File Server (Network Attached Storage)

Security Additions
------------------

* Windows - `Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (Depreciated) <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/mbsa-removal-and-guidance>`_ provides a streamlined method to identify missing security updates and common security misconfigurations.
* Linux/Mac - `Lynis <https://cisofy.com/lynis/>`_ is an open source security auditing tool. Used by system administrators, security professionals and auditors to evaluate the security defenses of their Linux and UNIX-based systems. It runs on the host itself, so it performs more extensive security scans than vulnerability scanners.
* File Server (NAS) - Access control lists on folders defining which folder can be accessed by which user or password protected folders.

Operations Issues
-----------------

* The MBSA and Lynis have to be executed on every machine individually.
* Administration of every individual machine is tough. Any changes in the security settings will have to be done manually by an IT person.

Small Enterprise
================

Current Users
-------------

45 People

Current Setup
-------------

* Micro Company Setup Included

Windows Domain Controller
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Active Directory Domain Services provide secure, structured, hierarchical data storage for objects in a network such as users, computers, printers and services.

Domain Name Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A DNS server hosts the information that enables client computers to resolve memorable, alphanumeric DNS names to the IP addresses that computers use to communicate with each other.

Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) enables information technology administrators to deploy the latest Microsoft product updates. A WSUS server can be the update source for other WSUS servers within the organization. Refer `Deploy Windows Server Update Services in Your Organization <https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh852340(v=ws.11).aspx>`_ 

DHCP Server
^^^^^^^^^^^

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers on your network automatically provide client computers and other TCP/IP based network devices with valid IP addresses.

Others
^^^^^^
* Company decided to take 8 Linux Servers (Debian, CentOS, Arch-Linux and Red-Hat).
* Added two servers hosting three web-application running on `IIS-WebServer <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/>`_, `Apache Tomcat <http://tomcat.apache.org/>`_ and `Nginx <https://nginx.org/en/docs/>`_.

Operations Issues
-----------------

* How to manage multiple Linux machines and make sure they are hardened and compliant to security standards such as `CIS <https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/>`_ (Center for Internet Security) or `STIG <https://www.stigviewer.com/stigs>`_ (Security Technical Implementation Guide). 

Minimum Baseline Security Standard (MBSS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
* `STIG <https://www.stigviewer.com/stigs>`_: A Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) is a cybersecurity methodology for standardizing security protocols within networks, servers, computers, and logical designs to enhance overall security. These guides, when implemented, enhance security for software, hardware, physical and logical architectures to further reduce vulnerabilities.
 
* `CIS <https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/>`_: CIS Benchmarks help you safeguard systems, software, and networks against today's evolving cyber threats. Developed by an international community of cybersecurity experts, the CIS Benchmarks are configuration guidelines for over 100 technologies and platforms.

Security Additions
------------------

Security Compliance Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Security Compliance Manager <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/tn-archive/cc677002(v=technet.10)>`_: SCM enables you to quickly configure and manage computers and your private cloud using Group Policy and Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager. SCM 4.0 provides ready-to-deploy policies based on Microsoft Security Guide recommendations and industry best practices, allowing you to easily manage configuration drift, and address compliance requirements for Windows operating systems and Microsoft applications. However, effective 15th June 2017, Microsoft retired SCM `Security Compliance Manager (SCM) retired; new tools and procedures <https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/secguide/2017/06/15/security-compliance-manager-scm-retired-new-tools-and-procedures/>`_ and introduced Security Compliance Toolkit.

Security Compliance Toolkit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Microsoft `Security Configuration Toolkit <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319>`_ enables enterprise security administrators to effectively manage their enterprise’s Group Policy Objects (GPOs).  Using the toolkit, administrators can compare their current GPOs with Microsoft-recommended GPO baselines or other baselines, edit them, store them in GPO backup file format, and apply them via a Domain Controller or inject them directly into testbed hosts to test their effects. The Security Configuration Toolkit consists of two tools, Policy Analyzer and LGPO, and a set of configuration baselines for different releases of Windows. 

* Policy Analyzer: Policy Analyzer is a utility for analyzing and comparing sets of Group Policy Objects (GPOs). It can highlight when a set of Group Policies has redundant settings or internal inconsistencies and then highlight the differences between versions or sets of Group Policies. It can also compare GPOs against current local policy settings, local registry settings, and then export results to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. 

* LGPO: LGPO is a tool for transferring Group Policy directly between a host’s registry and a GPO backup file, bypassing the Domain Controller.  This gives administrators a simple way to verify the effects of their Group Policy settings directly.

Operations Additions
--------------------

Infrastructure Automation Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `Puppet <https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/>`_: Puppet is an open-source software configuration management tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems as well as on Microsoft Windows. It was created to easily automate repetitive and error-prone system administration tasks. Puppet's easy-to-read declarative language allows you to declare how your systems should be configured to do their jobs.
* `Ansible <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html>`_ is an open-source automation engine that automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.
* `SaltStack <https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/contents.html>`_: SaltStack is a Python-based open-source configuration management software and remote execution engine. Supporting the "Infrastructure as Code" approach to deployment and cloud management.
* `Chef <https://docs.chef.io/>`_: Chef lets you manage them all by turning infrastructure into code. Infrastructure described as code is flexible, versionable, human-readable, and testable.
* `Powershell Desired State Configuration <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/overview>`_: DSC is a management platform in PowerShell that enables you to manage your IT and development infrastructure with configuration as code.

Automation Tools Addition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If we are utilizing Automation Tools above, there are few other tools which should be known such as 

* `Inspec <https://docs.chef.io/inspec/>`_: InSpec is an open-source testing framework for infrastructure with a human-readable language for specifying compliance, security and other policy requirements. When compliance is code, you can integrate automated tests that check for adherence to policy into any stage of your deployment pipeline.

* `DSC Environment Analyzer (DSCEA) <https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/ralphkyttle/2017/03/21/introducing-dscea/>`_: is a PowerShell module that uses the declarative nature of Desired State Configuration to scan systems in an environment against a defined reference MOF file and generate compliance reports as to whether systems match the desired configuration. DSCEA is hosted at `DSCEA Github <https://github.com/Microsoft/DSCEA>`_  and can be downloaded from the `PowerShell Gallery <https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/DSCEA>`_. Another tool which might be helpful is `BaselineManagement <https://github.com/Microsoft/BaselineManagement>`_ which is a conversion tool used to convert Group Policy and SCM baselines into DSC.

* `Kitchen <http://kitchen.ci/>`_: Kitchen provides a test harness to execute your infrastructure code on one or more platforms in isolation. A driver plugin architecture is used which lets you run your code on various cloud providers and virtualization technologies such as Amazon EC2, Google GCE, Azure, Blue Box, CloudStack, Digital Ocean, Rackspace, OpenStack, Vagrant, Docker, LXC containers, and more. In short, whatever code we wrote for one platform or operating system (example: Debian 8), utilizing Kitchen, we can test it on multiple platforms.

Linters
^^^^^^^

Most of the linters ideally should be present in `Microsoft Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ as an extension.

* `Rubocop <http://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_: RuboCop is a Ruby static code analyzer. Out of the box it will enforce many of the guidelines outlined in the community `Ruby Style Guide <https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide>`_ . If we are writing code in ruby, rubocop makes sure that it is written according to the Ruby style guide.

* `Puppet-Linter <http://puppet-lint.com/>`_: Puppet Lint tests Puppet code against the recommended Puppet language style guide. Puppet Lint validates only code style; it does not validate syntax.

* `Pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`_: Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce a coding standard and looks for code smells. It can also look for certain type errors, it can recommend suggestions about how particular blocks can be refactored and can offer you details about the code’s complexity.

* `rst-lint <https://github.com/twolfson/restructuredtext-lint>`_: Restructured Text Linter

* PHP

PHP_CodeSniffer is an essential development tool that ensures your code remains clean and consistent.:w

  * `phpmd <https://phpmd.org/>`_ - PHP Mess Detector takes a given PHP source code base and look for several potential problems within that source such as Possible bugs, Suboptimal code, Overcomplicated expressions, Unused parameters, methods, properties.

* HTML  

 * `TIDY <https://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/>`_ 
   
Security Breach 1
=================

Let's assume a security breach happened at this point of time.

* Customer data was ex-filtrated from one of the internal servers. 
* A mis-configured web-application server was exploited and the Product website was defaced.
* Open SMTP Server: A internal employee was able to send a email posing as CFO and asked the finance department to transfer money to attackers bank.

Security Additions
------------------

ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>`_: Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of solving a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data so you can discover the expected and uncover the unexpected.
* `Logstash <https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash>`_: Logstash is an open source, server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to your favorite “stash.” (Elasticsearch).
* `Kibana <https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana>`_ : Kibana lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so you can do anything from learning why you're getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on your quarterly numbers.

Windows Event Forwarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) reads any operational or administrative event log on a device in your organization and forwards the events you choose to a Windows Event Collector (WEC) server. There are some awesome blogs to read for better utilization of WEF.

* Jessica Payne's `Monitoring what matters – Windows Event Forwarding for everyone (even if you already have a SIEM.) <https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/jepayne/2015/11/23/monitoring-what-matters-windows-event-forwarding-for-everyone-even-if-you-already-have-a-siem/>`_  Suggests only five things to monitor:

 * Security Event Logs being cleared
 * High value groups like Domain Admins being Changed
 * Local administrator groups being changed
 * Local users being created or deleted on member systems
 * New Services being installed, particularly on Domain Controllers (as this is often an indicator of malware or lateral movement behavior.)

* Microsoft's `Use Windows Event Forwarding to help with intrusion detection <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/threat-protection/use-windows-event-forwarding-to-assist-in-instrusion-detection>`_ 

* Russell Tomkins has written a blog on creating `Creating Custom Windows Event Forwarding Logs <https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/russellt/2016/05/18/creating-custom-windows-event-forwarding-logs/>`_ 

 * Answers the question of "We don't want everything in Forwarded Events, can we create separate logs for my subscriptions?" 

* Russell Tomkins has written another blog on `Introducing Project Sauron – Centralised Storage of Windows Events – Domain Controller Edition <https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/russellt/2017/05/09/project-sauron-introduction/>`_ 

 * Using the Project Sauron Framework, the deployment of centralised Windows Event Collector (WEC) server becomes almost simple. 
 * Using custom WEC subscriptions, the required events are forwarded into dedicated event channels and dedicated .evtx file. 
 * Creation and deployment of your own custom solution or re-using one the pre-built solutions can have you operational in matter of hours not months.

* BeyondTrust has written `Centralizing Windows Events with Event Forwarding <https://www.beyondtrust.com/docs/privilege-management/documents/windows-mac/pmr-event-centralization.pdf>`_ provides guidance on how to centralize Privilege Guard events to a central server using Windows Event Forwarding.
