Investing in stock markets
--------------------------

Basic process

- Categorization - BSE classifies companies in stock markets into various groups. We stick to Group A, B, M or X for our investments. Maybe buy 10 - 20 stocks
- Fundamental Analysis - To check if the company is fundamentally strong, as this is the most important decision.
- Technical Analysis - To have a guess at the broad price range & time range to transact in a stock
- Qualitative Analysis - To understand an industry or company deeper this is an optional exercise generally on a long term basis (annually).

Fundamental Analysis
====================

Method used by value investors for long term investments. It helps to check the growth prospects of the company and financial soundness.

- The key goal of the company is to make profits. Profit is what is left after all costs are deducted from Sales.

Fundamental Rule 1
------------------

- By analysing revenue and operating margin
  - If sales is increasing consistently, it is a good sign
  - At the same time, if operating margin has been stable, it's even better
  - If sales is growing faster than industry growth rate, we have a good choice
- Disclaimer
  - If a company is reducing prices to increases sales, be aware
  - May be the company is facing competition
  - May be the customers are not satisfied with the product
  - Check if the operating margins are getting impacted
- Checkpoint 1
  - Check if revenue is growing faster than industry growth rate
  - Operating Margin is stable or increasing
- Checkpoint 2
  - Check if the company is profitable
  - Check if the company is increasing profitability or maintaining it
- Checkpoint 3
  - 3 key ratios you must check for
    - PE Ratio or Price to Earnings Ratio
      - When we buy clothes, we look at price.
      - When we buy stocks, we look at PE Ratio.
      - If a good quality company is below PE of 15, considered cheap to buy. However number `15` varies from industry to industry.
      - Calculate Industry PE!
    - Debt - Equity Ratio
      - No debt is best debt
      - Debt equity ratio < 1 is generally preferable
      - Debt equity ratio > 1 can be dangerous if debt is not utilized well
      - Banks, NBFCs have DE > 1, because they owe debt to RBI
    - Return on Equity or ROE
      - Return to shareholders or promoters of the company
      - ROE > 25 % is preferable
      - If the owners will get better ROE, they will invest more in the business else they will make FDs.

Checklist for fundamental analysis
----------------------------------

- Revenue : Revenue is important to analyse business growth
- OPM     : OPM is important to check operational efficiency
- PAT%    : PAT% is important to understand profitability
- PE      : PE Ratio tells how expensive the stock is
- DE      : Debt equity ratio tells how much company owes to others
- ROE     : Return on equity is the key motivation for owners

Technical Analysis
==================

Technical analysis is used to get the feel of stock movement. It provides rough idea of direction & price.

Checklist
---------

- Volume Traded
  - When we have bullish candles and volume is high, that means big hands are buying.
    - Generally this a good time to buy
    - Not guaranteed
  - When you have bullish candles and volume is low, that means weak hands are buying
    - This might be a trap

      - Go to Charts -> Studies -> Moving Average -> Volume
      - By Default last 50 days (We may change it to 100 days etc.)

- Pivot Points - Support & Resistance
  - To make our buying decision even better, next we introduce price levels
    - Support - This is the price where a falling stock may stop
      - If a stock breaks the support level successfully, it is called a breakdown.
      - After a breakdown, stock generally rallies down.
    - Resistance - This is the price which a rising stock may find difficult to break.
      - If a stock breaks the resistance level successfully, it is called a breakout.
      - After a breakout, stock generally rallies up.
    - Not guaranteed
  - Conclusion
    - Buy close to support
    - Swing Trading: Buy close to support, sell close to resistance
  - Zerodha
    - Go to Charts -> Studies -> Pivot Points
- RSI - Relative Strength Indicator
  - Conclusion
    - If a stock has RSI >= 80, it is generally over-bought
    - If a stock has RSI <= 20, it is generally over-sold
  - Zerodha
    - Go to Charts -> Studies -> RSI

Conclusion
----------

- First identify the broad trend of the stock
- If there seems a change from downturn to upturn this is even better
  - The quality stock is giving strong +ve signals for Volume, Pivot Points, RSI successively
  - This might be a good sign to buy
- If there seems a change from upturn to downturn
  - The stock is giving strong -ve signals for Volume, Pivot Points, RSI successively
  - If you want, you may exit

Definitions
===========

Balance sheet
-------------

Assets
^^^^^^

Assets, both tangible and intangible, are owned by the company. An asset is a resource controlled by the company and is expected to have an economic value in the future. Typical examples of assets include plants, machinery, cash, brands, patents etc.

- Non-current Assets: Noncurrent assets are a company's long-term investments for which the full value will not be realized within the accounting year. They are typically highly illiquid, meaning these assets cannot easily be converted into cash. Examples of noncurrent assets include investments, intellectual property, real estate, and equipment.
  
  - Property, plant, and equipment are tangible assets, meaning they are physical in nature or can be touched; as a result, they are not easily converted into cash.
  - A right-of-use asset, or ROU asset, is an asset that represents a lessee's privilege to use a leased item over the duration of an agreed-upon lease term.
  - Capital work in progress means if any machine is not completed till the date of the balance sheet all the costs incurred on the same are added to the Capital work in progress account.
  - Goodwill is an intangible asset that is associated with the purchase of one company by another. It represents value that can give the acquiring company a competitive advantage. The value of a company's name, brand reputation, loyal customer base, solid customer service, good employee relations, and proprietary technology represent aspects of goodwill.
  - A deferred tax asset is an item on a company's balance sheet that reduces its taxable income in the future. Such a line item asset can be found when a business overpays its taxes. This money will eventually be returned to the business in the form of tax relief. Therefore, the overpayment becomes an asset to the company.

- Current Assets:
  - Inventory refers to the raw materials used in production as well as the goods produced that are available for sale.
  - Financial assets
    - Trade receivables are defined as the amount owed to a business by its customers following the sale of goods or services on credit. 
    - Cash and cash equivalents reports the value of a company's assets that are cash or can be converted into cash immediately. Cash equivalents include bank accounts and marketable securities, which are debt securities with maturities of less than 90 days.
      - Cash: what cash a cashier holds in hand for daily operations. 
      - Cash equivalents: short term securities like FD's which can be converted immediately into cash or exchanged.
    - "Bank balance other than Cash and Cash equivalents" defined as balance with bank having a restriction regarding it's liquidity. Balances with banks held as margin money or security against borrowings, guarantees, other commitments etc are included in bank balances other than cash and cash equivalents.

Liability
^^^^^^^^^

Liability, on the other hand, represents the company's obligation. The company takes up the obligation because it believes these obligations will provide economic value in the long run. Liability in simple words is the loan that the company has taken, and it is obligated to repay.  Typical examples of obligation include short term borrowing, long term borrowing, payments due etc. Liabilities are of two types, namely current and non-current.

- A non-current liability refers to the financial obligations in a company's balance sheet that are not expected to be paid within one year. Non-current liabilities are due in the long term, compared to short-term liabilities, which are due within one year.
  - Long-term borrowing consists of a long application process where repayments are made for several years in order to pay off the loan. This loan is borrowed to fulfill the business needs on a large scale. However, short-term borrowing consists of a small loan amount that is available within a short period of time, as few as 24 hours.
  - A deferred tax liability is a listing on a company's balance sheet that records taxes that are owed but are not due to be paid until a future date. The liability is deferred due to a difference in timing between when the tax was accrued and when it is due to be paid.


Equities and Liabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Share capital is the money a company raises by issuing common or preferred stock. The amount of share capital or equity financing a company has can change over time with additional public offerings.

Cash Flow Statement
-------------------

- Operational activities (OA): Activities related to the daily core business operations are called operational activities. Typical operating activities include sales, marketing, manufacturing, technology upgrade, resource hiring etc.
- Investing activities (IA): Activities about investments that the company makes intending to reap benefits at a later stage. Examples include parking money in interest-bearing instruments, investing in equity shares, investing in land, property, plant and equipment, intangibles and other non-current assets etc.
- Financing activities (FA): Activities about all financial transactions of the company such as distributing dividends, paying interest to service debt, raising fresh debt, issuing corporate bonds etc

General Concepts
----------------

- Bull Market: Optimism (Prices going up)
- Bear Market: Pessimism (Prices going down)
