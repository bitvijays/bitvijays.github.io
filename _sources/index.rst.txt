The Magic of Learning			
#####################


**Hey there!** Few years back, when we started our journey in Infosec, we didn't had proper guidance. At that point of time, we decided to share our knowledge gathered during this journey with the community. The blog entries below can be seen as reading material for anyone starting in the InfoSec Community or even a one-stop-reference for a seasoned InfoSec person. 

Currently, **five series** have been published:

- **The Essentials** that covers the essential concepts/skills for somebody who wants to enter the field of CyberSecurity such as Cybersecurity in an Enterprise, Linux Basics, cloud, opensource and secure software development concepts.
- **Infrastructure Pentest** that covers all the phases of Infrastructure Pentest as described by `The Penetration Testing Execution Standard <http://www.pentest-standard.org/>`_ such as Intelligence Gathering, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, Post Exploitation, Reporting and Configuration Review.
- **Vulnerable Machines**: Knowledge gained by solving/reading write-ups of vulnerable machines provided by `VulnHub <https://www.vulnhub.com/>`_, `Hack the Box <https://www.hackthebox.eu/en>`_ and others.
- **Capture the flag** covers what we have learned by solving Capture the flag (CTF) challenges such as Binary Exploitation and Forensics.
- **Critical Infrastructure** covers the concepts required to Pentest or Secure a Electrical Grid.
