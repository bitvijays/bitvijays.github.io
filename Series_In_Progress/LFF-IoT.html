<h2>UART Communication<a class="headerlink" href="#uart-communication" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Universal Asynchronous Receiver/ Transmitter is a way of serial communication allowing two different components on a device to talk to each other without the requirement of a clock.</p>
<p>From a security standpoint, the ability to interact with UART will be useful to read device debug logs, get unauthenticated root shell, bootloader access.</p>
<p>Serial communication is used to transfer one bit at a time through a given medium. Examples RS232, USB, PCI, HDMI, Ethernet, SPI, I2C, CAN.</p>
<section id="uart-data-packet">
<h3>UART Data Packet<a class="headerlink" href="#uart-data-packet" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>UART data packet consists of</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Starting Bit: Symbolizes that the UART data is going to be followed next. Usually a low pulse (0).</p></li>
<li><p>Message : Actual message that is to be transferred as an 8-bit format.</p></li>
<li><p>Parity bit : is used to perform error and data corruption checking by counting the number of high or low values in the message, and based on whether it’s an odd parity or an even parity, it would tell that the data is not correct.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop bit: Final bit which symbolizes that the message has now completed. Usually done by a high pulse (1).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Devices may have configuration of 8N1 - means 8 data bits, no parity bits and 1 stop bit. We may connect a Logic Analyzer to device’s UART interfaces.</p>
<p>A logic analyzer is a device which helps display various signals and logic levels from a digital circuit. Saleae Logic Analyzer or Open Workbench Logic Sniffer is a good logic analyzer.</p>

<h3>Type of UART Ports<a class="headerlink" href="#type-of-uart-ports" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>UART port could either be hardware or software based. Atmel microcontrollers - AT89S52 or ATMEGA328 has one hardware serial port and a user can emulate more software UART ports on specific GPIOs (General Purpose Input Output). Software based UART
may be required to connect multiple devices via UART to a given device.</p>
<p>UART, JTAG, SPI, I2C are mainly present either to provide additional functionality to the developer or facilitate component to component communication.</p>

<section id="baud-rate">
<h3>Baud Rate<a class="headerlink" href="#baud-rate" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Baud rate specifies the rate at which data is transferred between devices, or the number of bits per second that are being transferred. As there is no clock line, both the devices need to have mutual understanding of speed of data communication.</p>
<p>Security research first step is to identify the baud rate of the target device. The common baud rates are 9600, 38400, 19200, 57600 and 115200. We can use a script written by Craig Heffner <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">`baudrate.py &lt;https://github.com/devttys0/baudrate/blob/master/baudrate.py`_</span></a>
which allows us to change baud rates while maintaining a serial connection, to identify what is the correct value of the baud rate by looking at the output and visually inspecting for readable output.</p>

<section id="connections-for-uart-exploitation">
<h3>Connections for UART Exploitation<a class="headerlink" href="#connections-for-uart-exploitation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>To perform UART based exploitation, we need two primary components - target device and a device which could emulate a serial connection to access the end device.</p>
<p>Identifying UART ports can be done visually by looking for 3 or 4 pins close to each other.</p>
<p>UART consists of four pins</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Transmit (Tx) : Transmits data from the device to the other end.</p></li>
<li><p>Receive (Rx) : Receives data from the other end to the device</p></li>
<li><p>Ground (GND) : Ground reference pin</p></li>
<li><p>Voltage (Vcc) : Voltage, usually 3.3V or 5V.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can use multi-meter/ logic analyzer to identify the pins based on either the continuity test (for GND) or by looking at the voltage difference (for the remaining three pins).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Ground will constant low voltage?</p></li>
<li><p>Vcc would have constant high voltage</p></li>
<li><p>Tx pin would have high/ low voltage during the bootup process because of the initial data transfer.</p></li>
<li><p>Rx might have low voltage during start-up.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Either screen or minicom can be used to connect with the device after finding the baud rate.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">screen</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">ttyUSB0</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">COM</span> <span class="n">port</span> <span class="n">used</span> <span class="n">by</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">connector</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">baudrate</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Things to remember</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Connections are correct. e.g. Tx from one device goes to the Rx of other and Rx of other device goes to the Tx.</p></li>
<li><p>GND is connected to other device’s Ground.</p></li>
<li><p>Vcc is not connected to anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Baudrate is correctly identified.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once, we have access to the UART, interaction with bootloader, modification of certain values and dumping of firmware over UART is possible.</p>

<h1>Exploitation using I2C and SPI<a class="headerlink" href="#exploitation-using-i2c-and-spi" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Both SPI and I2C are useful bus protocols used for data communication between different components in an Embedded device circuit. We can SPI and I2C exploitation techniques to dump contents (including firmware and other sensitive secrets)
from a device’s flash chip, or write content (such as malicious firmware image) to the flash chip.</p>
<section id="i2c-inter-intergrate-circuit">
<h2>I2C (Inter-Intergrate Circuit)<a class="headerlink" href="#i2c-inter-intergrate-circuit" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>I2C is a multi-master protocol with only two wires being required to enable data exchange - Serial Data (SDA) and Serial Clock (SCL). I2C is only half-duplex which means it can only send or receive data at a given point of time.
I2C and SPI are meant for communicating with other peripherals located on the same circuit board. The SDA is for the data exchange, whereas the SCL (Clock line) is controlled by master and determines the speed at which the data exchange takes place.
The master also holds the address and memory location of all the various slaves devices which are used during any communication.</p>
<p>In I2C, there can be multiple masters, interacting with various slaves. That configuration is called a multi-master mode. Imagine what would happen if two masters wanted to take control over I2C bus at the same time, So, whichever master
pulls the SDA to LOW(0) first will gain the control of the bus.</p>
<p>SPI has faster data transmission rates compared to I2C, however it requires 3 pins for data transfer and one pin for Chip/ Slave select.</p>
<section id="understading-eeprom">
<h3>Understading EEPROM<a class="headerlink" href="#understading-eeprom" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>EEPROM stands for Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory. Serial EEPROMs typically have 8 pins:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Pin Name - Function</p></li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>#CS - Chip Select</p></li>
<li><p>SCK - Serial Data Clock</p></li>
<li><p>MISO - Serial Data Input</p></li>
<li><p>MOSI - Serial Data Output</p></li>
<li><p>GND - Ground</p></li>
<li><p>VCC Power Supply</p></li>
<li><p>#WP - Write Protect</p></li>
<li><p>#HOLD Suspends Serial Input</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Chip Select : Both SPI and I2C (and other protocols) usually have multiple slaves, it is required to select one slave amongst others for any given action. Chip Select an EEPROM when the #CS is low. When a device is not selected, there will
be no communication happening between the master and the slave and the Serial Data Output pin remains in a high impedence state.</p>
<p>Clock: The clock or SCK determines the speed with which data exchange and communication take place. In case of I2C, the slaves can modify and slow down thte clock in case the clock speed selected by master is too fast for the slaves. Process is known as Clock Streching.</p>
<p>MISO/ MOSI : Master-In-Slave-Out and Master-Out-Slave-In. In case of I2C, (half-duplex), it can either read or write data at a given point of time. In case of SPI, both read and write data happends at the same time.</p>
<p>Write Protect - Pin allows normal read/ write operations when it is HIGH. When #WP is active LOW, all write operations are inhibited.</p>
<p>HOLD: When a device is selected and a serial sequence is underwayone slave amongst others for any given action. Chip Select an EEPROM when the #CS is low. When a device is not selected, there will
be no communication happening between the master and the slave and the Serial Data Output pin remains in a high impedence state.</p>

<h2>SPI<a class="headerlink" href="#spi" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>SPI or Serial Peripheral Interface is full-duplex and consists of 3 wires - SCK, MOSI, MISO and additional chip select/ slave select. SPI is pretty loosely defined and different manufactures can modify the implementatiion in their own way,
To understand communication for any given chip on the target device, the best way is to lookup the datasheet and analyse how our target has implemented the SPI protocol for communication.</p>
<section id="how-does-spi-work">

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Master first configures the clock frequency according to the slave device clock frequency - typically up to a few MHz.</p></li>
<li><p>Fastest clock speed in SPI is half the speed of the master clock.</p></li>
<li><p>To start communication, the master selects the slave device with a logic level 0 on the SS line. Remember for every clock cycle, a full-duplex data transmission occurs.</p></li>
<li><p>The master initiates the communication by sending a bit on the MOSI line, which is read by the slave, whereas the slave sends a bit on the MISO line which is read by the master.</p></li>
<li><p>The most significatnt bit (MSB) is shifted first while a new least significant bit (LSB) is shifted into the same register. Once the register bit has been shifted out and in, the master and slave have successfully exchanged the register value.</p></li>

<h1>JTAG<a class="headerlink" href="#jtag" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>JTAG is not a standard or protocol but rather a way of testing different chips present on the device and debugging them. JTAG uses a technique known as Boundary Scan which enables the manufactures to test and diagose the assembled PCBs.</p>
<section id="boundary-scan">
<h2>Boundary Scan<a class="headerlink" href="#boundary-scan" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Boundary Scan is a technique to debug and test various pins of the different chips present in a circuit. This is done by adding a piece of component call Boundary Scan Cells near each pin of the chip which needs to be tested.
The various I/O pins of the device are connected serially to form a chain. This chain could then be accessed by Test Access Port (TAP).</p>
<p>The Boundary Scan happens by sending data into one of the chips and matching the output to the input to verify if everything is functioning properly. An external file known as Boundary Scan description language file defines the
capabilities of any single device’s Boundary Scan logic.</p>
</section>
<section id="test-access-port">
<h2>Test Access Port<a class="headerlink" href="#test-access-port" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Test Access Point is a collective name given to the JTAG interfaces present on a device. There are five signals which TAP uses which control a state machine</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Test Clock (TCK) - used to synchronize the internal state machine operation and to clock serial data into the various boundary cells.</p></li>
<li><p>Test Data In (TDI) - The Serial Input Data pin to the Scan cells.</p></li>
<li><p>Test Data Out (TDO) - sends the serial output data from the Scan cells.</p></li>
<li><p>Test Mode Select (TMS) - used to control the state of the TAP controller.</p></li>
<li><p>Test Reset (TRST, optional) - the reset pin which is active low. When it is driven low, it will reset the internal state machine.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The TCK, TMS, TRST pins drive a 16-bit TAP controller machine which manages the overall exchange of data and instructions.</p>
<p>The TAP controller is a 16-stage FSM (Finite State Machine) that proceeds from state to state, based on TMS and TCK signal. The TAP controller controls the test data register and the instruction register with the control signals.
If an instruction is to be sent, then the clock (TCK) is activated and the reset is set to active-low for the clock cycle. Once that is done, the reset signal is then deactivaed and the TMS is toggled to traverse the state machine for
further operation.</p>
<section id="boundary-scan-instructions">
<h3>Boundary Scan Instructions<a class="headerlink" href="#boundary-scan-instructions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Set of instructions defined by IEEE 149.1 standard which must be made availalbe for a device in case of Boundary Scan</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bypass : BYPASS instruction places the BYPASS register in the DR chain, so that the path from TDI and TDO involves only a single flip-flop (Shift-Resistor). This allows a specific chip to be tested in a serial chain without any overhead or
or interference from other chis.</p></li>
<li><p>SAMPLE/ PRELOAD: The SAMPLE/PRELOAD instruction places the Boundary Scan register in the DR chain. This instruction is used to preload the test data into the BSR. It is also used to copy the chip’s I/O value into the data register which can
then be moved out in successive shift-DR states.</p></li>
<li><p>EXTEST: The EXTEST instruction allows the user to test the off-chip circuitry. It is like the sample/ preload but also drives the value from the data register onto output pads.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="test-process">
<h3>Test process<a class="headerlink" href="#test-process" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Below is the overall test process would like for a Boundary Scan process:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The TAP controller applies test data on the TDI pins.</p></li>
<li><p>The BSR (Boundary Scan Register) monitors the input to the device and the data is captured by Boundary Scan cell.</p></li>
<li><p>The Data then goes in the device through the TDI pins.</p></li>
<li><p>The Data comes out of the device through the TDO pins.</p></li>
<li><p>The tester can verify the data on the output pin of the device and confirm if everything is working fine.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Identifying JTAG pinouts<a class="headerlink" href="#identifying-jtag-pinouts" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>We would use additional tools JTAGulator to effectively determine the individual pinouts present in our target device. Another important thins is in most of the devices, we will find the JTAG pads, instead of
JTAG pins or pads with holes, which makes it important to have a bit of soldering experience.</p>
<p>In JTAG, we have four pins</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>TDI</p></li>
<li><p>TDO</p></li>
<li><p>TMS</p></li>
<li><p>TCK</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can identify JTAG pinouts using two approaches which differ based on hardware used</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Using JTAGulator</p></li>
<li><p>Using Ardunio flashed with JTAGEnum</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using JTAGulator</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Open source hardware which helps us identify JTAG pinouts for a given target device. It has 24 I/O channels which can be used for pinout discovery and can also be used to detect UART pinouts.</p></li>
<li><p>It uses a FT232RL chip which allows it to handle entire USB protocol on a single chip and enables us to plug in the device and have it appear as a virtual serial port with which we can then interact using screen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To use JTAGulator, we need to connect all the various pins on our target device to the  JTAGulator channels, while connecting the ground to ground. Once done, we simply need to connect the JTAGulator to our system and run
screen with</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">screen</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">ttyUSB0</span> <span class="mi">115200</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Once, we are in the JTAGulator screen, the next step would be to set the target system voltage by hitting V to select the target voltage.</p></li>
<li><p>After selecting the voltage, the next step is to select a BYPASS scan to find out the pinouts. On selecting this, you wil lbe required to specify how many channels you have selected for the pinouts.</p></li>
<li><p>Once we have selected everything, JTAGulator will detect the various JTAGs pinouts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using Ardunio flashed with JTAGEnum</p>
<p>To use JTAGEnum with Ardunio, download the code from <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">`JTAGEnum &lt;https://github.com/cyphunk/JTAGenum`_</span></a></p>
<p>This is a cheaper option, however extremely slow and not having the ability to detect the UART pinouts like JTAGulator does.</p>
