<section id="proprietary-software">
<h2>Proprietary Software<a class="headerlink" href="#proprietary-software" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Proprietary software means that only the owners of such software
projects have full legal access to the source code involved. However,
they may grant inspection rights to trusted partners who have signed
non-disclosure agreements (NDAs).</p></li>
<li><p>To use proprietary software, end users must accept an end-user
license agreement restricting their rights presented during installation.</p></li>
<li><p>The end-user licenses generally restrict the user’s redistribution
rights, indemnify the product from damages due to either malfunction
or misuse, and prohibit trying to reconstruct source code or use
inside another product.</p></li>
<li><p>The difference between OSS (Open Source Software) and proprietary
models has nothing to do with price. One can charge for an
open-source product, and one can provide a proprietary product for
free. The license differences involve redistribution,
modification, and reuse of code.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="open-source-software">
<h2>Open Source Software<a class="headerlink" href="#open-source-software" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Open Source Software (OSS) means that the source code is made available
with a license that provides rights to examine, modify and redistribute,
without restriction on the user’s identity or purpose.</p>
<p>There is a multiplicity of licensing methods, falling into the two
general classifications:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Permissive (such as BSD-licensed software)</p></li>
<li><p>Restrictive (such as GPL-licensed software)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>OSS has had two different philosophical strains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>idealistic: There is a profound belief that all software should be
open for ideological and ethical reasons, not just technological
ones.</p></li>
<li><p>pragmatic: primary considerations are technical ones, including
faster and better development involving more contributors and reviews,
easier debugging.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="open-source-governance-models">
<h3>Open Source Governance Models<a class="headerlink" href="#open-source-governance-models" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>OSS projects differ according to the degrees of centralization, strong
influence by one or a few organizational entities, and the existence of
democratically-inspired decision mechanisms and leadership selection.</p>

<li><p>When progress is shared, not everyone has to solve the same
problems and make the same mistakes. Thus, progress can be made
much faster, and costs can be reduced.</p></li>

<li><p>It is embarrassing to show ugly, sloppy code</p></li>
<li><p>Coding standards and styles tend to be cleaner and more
consistent on community projects</p></li>
<li><p>More people have to understand and work on the code</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>There are more eyeballs examining code and looking for security
weaknesses before bad actors discover them</p></li>
<li><p>There is more input in the original design to avoid bad ideas</p></li>
<li><p>No security through obscurity</p></li>

<li><p>Formulating an Open Source Policy: Identifying how
much of our product already uses open source components and how
large an achievable goal can be is essential. Key considerations involve:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How much of the product is desired to be OSS? Are there current
closed-source components which could be replaced by open source
ones, perhaps both improving the product and its forward
maintenance?</p></li>
<li><p>Which license(s) fit our needs well, and which licenses
can be used in various OSS components we integrate, such as
libraries, APIs, etc.? Are we best off with permissive licenses
(like BSD or Apache) or more restrictive ones (like GPL)? Can we
mix them in one or more released products?</p></li>
<li><p>Do we have a strong enough understanding (and legal help) to set
up procedures for using both proprietary and open-source code in a
the way which protects both types?</p></li>
<li><p>How will we review the code to make sure things are being done
properly, and that inappropriately licensed material does not find its
way into our code, both the open and closed parts? Will we use
automated license compliance tools, such as
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.fossology.org/">FOSSology</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://spdx.org/tools">SPDX</a>, or <a class="reference external" href="http://git.linuxfoundation.org/foss-barcode.git/">FOSS Bar Code
Tracker</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A good starting point would be to check the <a class="reference external" href="https://compliance.linuxfoundation.org/references/tools/">Linux Foundation’s
Open Compliance
Program</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The other important things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Disclosure requirements require the organization to report to
any interested client or user information about all OSS
components, including information such as the original upstream
source, the version, licensing considerations and dependencies.
If our organization is using someone else’s upstream, we would
require the same information.</p></li>
<li><p>Security considerations also require documenting the different
OSS components used in the project. They need to be of high
quality and secure.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Implementing an Open Source Policy: A policy is worthless without
both a structure for ensuring implementation and having a dedicated
staff tasked with carrying it out.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Training will need to be developed (or outsourced), targeted to
more than one staff element, including Developers, Procurement,
Legal, Security.</p></li>
<li><p>Community participation and outreach can also be critical. Who are
the designated spokespeople? Who monitors developer participation and
contributions?</p></li>
<li><p>Specific procedures must be developed for (often
automated) code inspection of any incorporated elements for
license compliance, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear assignment of responsibility is required in all areas.</p></li>

<section id="working-in-oss-projects">
<h3>Working in OSS Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#working-in-oss-projects" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Before contributing to any OSS project, it is recommended to investigate,
understand its workflow and style, and identify the scope and nature of
work. Below are steps can help:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Identify how the project communicates; start by reading the mailing
list for the project. Also, study any existing archives. If there is
an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) network, join it.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand how contributions are submitted. Is it through mailing
lists? Email? A revision control system, such as git or subversion? A
good way to lessen our standing on the project is to be sloppy or
ignorant of proper procedures, including even trivial-sounding
matters like using an email client that does not mess up white space.</p></li>
<li><p>Study previous history. Has the idea been considered before and
rejected? Or, if generally seen as worthwhile, is there already an
individual or group working on the idea? If so, we should join them
in many cases, not start over.</p></li>
<li><p>Does the project offer veteran contributors as mentors?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other suggestions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Rather than beginning by submitting code, offering services for testing, finding bugs, and similar work is often far better. Many
open source projects complain that this is their weakest link.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure we are competent at whatever programming or scripting
the language the project uses; developers will be impatient in correcting
code on that level.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the right balance between asking for suggestions and review
early in the process, instead of waiting too long and dumping a lot
of poorly conceived work on people at once. No one enjoys
contributors who pontificate all the time without contributing code,
and no one likes massive patch sets that cannot be absorbed quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, please be polite and respectful, and avoid obscenities, flaming and
trolling. While some communities tolerate it, it should not be
encouraged, as it affects the quality of work and is just wrong.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="contributing-to-oss-projects">
<h4>Contributing to OSS Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#contributing-to-oss-projects" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>When contributing to OSS projects, we must keep in mind various things,
to ensure that we abide by the project’s and its community’s rules.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Study and Understand the Project DNA</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unless we start a new project, there will already be a
community-established ethos and formal or informal leadership
structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Why does this project exist, and why was it started?</p></li>
<li><p>Has it diverged far from its original purpose?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the contributing community large or small? Continuously active,
or only sporadically so?</p></li>
<li><p>Does it have a collective or singular governance structure?</p></li>
<li><p>What kind of license does it adopt, and is there a contributor
license agreement (CLA) we must agree to?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Figure Out What Itch We Want to Scratch</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most contributors get involved in open source projects because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is a bug/problem that interferes with their use of the
project</p></li>
<li><p>They want to add additional functionality to the project.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Sometimes, we are just interested in something cool and want to
learn about it.</p></li>
<li><p>Some projects have a “janitorial” list of things to do, relatively
straightforward tasks that can help get our feet wet.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Identify Maintainers and Their Work Flows and Methods</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There will always be maintainers whose job is to review
code submissions carefully. Having a good relationship with relevant
maintainers is crucial.</p></li>
<li><p>There may be one maintainer for the whole project (perhaps the
benevolent dictator). Still, for projects with many pieces and large
communities, there will be subsystem maintainers as well. A good
example is the Linux kernel community.</p></li>
<li><p>The job of a maintainer is difficult. They have to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Understand and review all submissions.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure they add something other than complication and do not
introduce bugs.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure they do not conflict with other patches.</p></li>
<li><p>Do all this in a timely fashion; it is very frustrating for
contributors if maintainers appear to need to be working on a review.</p></li>
<li><p>Do everything respectfully.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Be respectful and be patient. It will not be appreciated if we treat a maintainer as
someone who works for us or a demanding boss.</p></li>
<li><p>Offer to review other contributors’ submissions and be helpful.</p></li>
<li><p>Offer to debug new features and bug fixes; this is often one of
the most neglected areas in OSS development.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Get Early Input and Work in the Open</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As a new member of the community, we probably need to learn the
history. Our bright new idea might be an old one. If so,
perhaps the idea has been discussed and rejected. Or, perhaps
there was work on it, and it petered out for various reasons.
This does not mean the idea is a bad one; maybe it could not have
been done in the past, but is feasible now, as software and
hardware has evolved.</p></li>
<li><p>Propose the ideas to the community before we go very far with
them; take advantage of institutional memory. Get suggestions and
input.</p></li>
<li><p>Never introduce an idea and suggest someone else do it; this
is often a sure road to oblivion (“Show me the code!”).</p></li>
<li><p>Say we ask for opinions before we go too far to see if people think it is worthwhile and feasible.</p></li>
<li><p>In doing this, we will get more eyeballs from the beginning, which can only help. If we are uncomfortable having other people
look at work often, OSS is not for you!</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Contribute Incremental Bits, Not Large Code Dumps</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Code contributions are best digested in small unit-sized bites.
Overloading maintainers and mailing lists with large code dumps is
a good way to make sure code is not reviewed.</p></li>
<li><p>Besides just being a lot for reviewers to consume, it becomes
difficult to process the individual parts; perhaps most of the
changes are good, but some require modification. It is hard to
back out if it is in one large patch.</p></li>
<li><p>So, breaking up work into sequential patches is
often the best way. For example, we may have a separate
patch for each file modified.</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible functionality will only work once all patches
are included. That’s fine. Wings and feet were not fully
functional as they began to evolve.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Leave Your Ego at the Door: Do Not Be Thin-Skinned</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Like any Internet-based community, OSS projects tend to attract
some rather interesting characters. Unfortunately, some of them
can be pretty irritating, even offensive.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave the ego at the door. Take a deep breath if someone is nasty and does not answer kindly.</p></li>
<li><p>Respect other opinions. The approach may not be the best one.
Learn when to yield if we want to get code upstream. When making
criticisms or engaging in any discussion thread, be polite and
respectful.</p></li>
<li><p>If someone is going over the line, rely on community members with
a long history to try and calm things down and resolve issues. Do
not feed the trolls.</p></li>
<li><p>Occasionally, contributors may be purged from a project. This is
a pretty rare occurrence. The main reason is maintainer
inactivity or being unpleasant.</p></li>
<li><p>While in a good project, every effort is made to keep things
energetic but mellow, there can be problems with behaviour
involving discrimination and offensive conduct to
Race, Sex, Sexual preference, Religion, National origin.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, expressing (strongly) political or religious
sentiments and opinions are generally out of place. People from
rather far sides of the spectrum often work together successfully.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Be Patient, Develop Long-Term Relationships, and Be Helpful</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most projects do not appreciate drive-by contributors: those who
provide some enhancement or fix but disappear.</p></li>
<li><p>Besides the initial contribution, there often needs to be a
commitment to long-term maintenance. Otherwise, bit rot will ensue
for all but trivial contributions.</p></li>
<li><p>For this reason, one sometimes sees good code rejected unless
someone steps forward and volunteers long-term maintenance. Thus,
think about the future when making submissions.</p></li>
<li><p>One good way to develop (good) long-term relationships in the
community is to offer to help in areas not directly related to
our main interests.</p></li>
<li><p>It is helpful to be viewed as a good citizen. This is particularly
true if we are contributing as part of a commercial organization;
community members will see us as a real community member, not just someone exploiting it.</p></li>

materials on the job or in personal projects. Open-source materials
include software, hardware designs, tools, documents,
audio recordings, and image files. Although open-source materials are

<h3>Definition<a class="headerlink" href="#definition" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A software license is a legal instrument … governing the use or

<section id="license-types">
<h3>License Types<a class="headerlink" href="#license-types" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Proprietary licenses are licenses where the copyright holder keeps
many or most of the rights to themselves and often adds additional
restrictions on what users can do with the software. Proprietary
licenses are specific to a company or a project.</p></li>
<li><p>Open source licenses are generally understood to follow
the definition of open source developed by the Open Source Initiative
organization. They allow the software to be freely used, modified and
shared. Open-source licenses are generally grouped as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Permissive or Copyleft: The license might impose few or no
requirements on the licensee, permitting use and redistribution in
proprietary applications. Or it might require redistributors to
provide downstream recipients the same freedoms they received
for the upstream software or for their works derived from it
or added to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Patent Grant or No Patent Grant: A patent grant can either be
explicitly specified or implied by the text (called implicit).
Or, there can be no patent grant associated with some licenses,
which some may consider not to be open-source licenses as a
result.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about open source licenses, review the Open Source
Initiative’s website - “<a class="reference external" href="https://opensource.org/licenses">Licenses &amp;
Standards</a>”.</p>
<p>For code to be considered open source, the license the code is released
under should comply with the properties listed in the <a class="reference external" href="https://opensource.org/osd-annotated">Open Source
Definition</a> maintained by the
<a class="reference external" href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative (OSI)</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Free Redistribution: The license shall not restrict any party from
selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate
software distribution containing programs from several different
sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for
such sale.</p></li>
<li><p>Source Code: The program must include source code and must allow
distribution in source code as well as compiled form.</p></li>
<li><p>Derived Works: The license must allow modifications and derived
works and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as
the license of the original software.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrity of the Author’s Source Code: The license may restrict
source code from being distributed in modified form only if the
license allows the distribution of “patch files” with the source code
for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license
must explicitly permit the distribution of software built from modified
source code. The license may require derived works to carry a
different name or version number from the original software.</p></li>
<li><p>No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups: The license must not
discriminate against any person or group of persons.</p></li>
<li><p>No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor: The license must not
restrict anyone from using the program in a specific field of
endeavour. For example, it may not restrict the program from being
used in a business or for genetic research.</p></li>

<h3>Permissive or Copyleft License<a class="headerlink" href="#permissive-or-copyleft-license" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Permissive licenses are those with minimal requirements on what you
must do when redistributing the software. Those requirements are
typically limited to things like retaining or delivering attribution
notices. Because requirements are minimal, it is often easier for
permissively-licensed software to be combined with copyleft and/or
proprietary software, but there are compatibility issues in some
cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Common examples of permissive licenses are: MIT, BSD-2-Clause and
BSD-3-Clause, Apache-2.0</p></li>
<li><p>Copyleft licenses are sometimes called protective or reciprocal
licenses. The term copyleft originated from the GNU licenses but has
been expanded over time to cover other licenses. Copyleft licenses
have requirements for how the software can be redistributed and requirements that may impact how derivative works can be
distributed.</p></li>
<li><p>These licenses tend to get grouped into strong and weak copyleft
licenses.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">Wikipedia</a> defines
“weak copyleft” as</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Weak copyleft” refers to licenses where not all derived works inherit the copyleft license; whether a derived work inherits or not often depends on how it was derived.</p></li>
<li><p>“Weak copyleft” licenses are generally used for the creation of software libraries to allow other software to link to the library, and then be redistributed without the legal requirement for the work to be distributed under the library’s copyleft license.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of “weak copyleft” licenses are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lesser GNU Public License (written as LGPL-2.0, LGPL-2.1 or
LGPL-3.0)</p></li>
<li><p>Mozilla Public Licenses (written as MPL-1.0, MPL-1.1 or
MPL-2.0)</p></li>
<li><p>Eclipse Public License (written as EPL-1.0 or EPL-2.0)</p></li>
<li><p>Common Development and Distribution License (written as
CDDL-1.0 or CDDL-1.1)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>“Strong copyleft” refers to the class of licenses which specify the practice of offering people the right to distribute freely copies and modified versions of a work, with the stipulation that the same rights be preserved in derivative works down the line.</p></li>
<li><p>The best-known examples of “strong copyleft” licenses are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>GNU General Public Licenses (GPL-2.0 and GPL-3.0)</p></li>
<li><p>Affero General Public License (AGPL-3.0)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>These licenses follow the free software definition, which gives
each person possessing a copy of the work the same freedoms as the
author, namely: the freedom to use the work, the freedom to study
the work, the freedom to copy and share the work with others, the
freedom to modify the work, and the freedom to distribute modified
and therefore derivative works. Those derivative works, including
forks, would need to retain the same license as the original code
if we are not the copyright holder of the original code.</p></li>

process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter.
Patents provide the right to exclude others from making, using,
selling, offering for sale, or importing the patented invention for
the term of the patent.</p></li>
<li><p>By explicitly granting patent rights as part of a license, the
license makes clear that others are not excluded from using any of

<h3>What Does a Reference to a License Look Like in a File?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-a-reference-to-a-license-look-like-in-a-file" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Full license text is frequently long and complex, and not always
suitable to put in each file in a project.</p>
<p>It is a common practice to put a LICENSE file at the top level of the
project and include the full text of the license(s) that may be in
effect for the project as a whole. For the other files in a project, by
referring to the actual license within each file — even if that
reference doesn’t include the full license text — ambiguity is removed
as to which license governs that file, particularly when there are
multiple licenses being used by a project.</p>
<p>For example, a project may decide to include code from a different
project to add new functionality, and the included project is under a
different license.</p>
<p>What should a license reference actually look like in a file? You may
want to include the following items as a comment in the file with the
code:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A standard header for the license (if it exists).</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Copyright is established by national laws, and gives the copyright
holder some exclusive rights to control a creative work’s use and
distribution. Copyright holders have exclusive rights to their
creative expression. Copyright is used to protect tangible forms of
expression, which are sometimes referred to as original works of
authorship.</p></li>
<li><p>Normally, we think of copyrights protecting things like books,
movies, music, maps, and art. Copyright can also be used to protect
the expression of hardware designs and software, as well as other
creative works.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="what-is-a-copyright">
<h3>What Is a Copyright?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-copyright" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Copyright holders are those able to define the license under which an
original work can be used. The license is also known as the “terms of
use”.</p>
<p>Wikipedia’s defines “Copyright is a legal right created by the law of a
country that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights for
its use and distribution.”</p>
<p>It is important to note that countries have their own copyright laws. To
a certain extent, international treaties like the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention">Berne
Convention</a> and the
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Copyright_Convention">Universal Copyright
Convention</a>
have standardized the treatment, but local variations in law do exist.</p>
<p>Original “work” can refer to creative, intellectual or artistic output.
Software source code written by a person is considered an original work.
Copyright does not cover the ideas or information, but rather how they
are expressed (or written down). Ideas and algorithms can be covered by
patent law instead. The work must be considered as original, rather than
copied from somewhere else to be covered.</p>
<p>Copyrights were originally created to preserve the rights of authors,
when printing presses started to produce books in quantity. Over time,
as each country evolved its own copyright law, at the international
level it became harder and harder to figure out what rights applied to
work created in one country but copied and reproduced in another.</p>
<p>In 1886, an international agreement was created in Berne, Switzerland,
governing copyright. The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary
and Artistic Works requires those countries that have signed the
convention to treat the copyright of works of authors from other
signatory countries (known as members of the Berne Union) at least as
well as those of its own nationals. This was also the first attempt to
provide a minimum standard for copyright law. In particular, under the
Berne Convention, copyright is automatic and need not be obtained
through official registration with any government office. Up until this
time, in some countries, registration with the government was required
to be considered to hold copyright</p>
<section id="who-is-a-copyright-holder">
<h4>Who Is a Copyright Holder?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-is-a-copyright-holder" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The author of the work is generally considered to be the copyright
holder. In situations where there are multiple authors, each has a set
of rights to use or license the work, and they are commonly referred to
as rights holders.</p>
<p>Often, when the work was created in the course of the author’s
employment, it is considered as a “work for hire” and the employer is
the copyright holder. For example, the “Copyright, Designs, and Patents
Act of 1988” (which is a United Kingdom law), provides that if a
copyrighted work is made by an employee in the course of that
employment, the copyright is automatically owned by the employer. This
can be different in some jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, as an
example.</p>
<p>The rights of the copyright holder can also be assigned to another
organization or individual.</p>
<p>Copyright notices in open source software projects tend to follow one of
two different categories of formats.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Historical Format:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Traditionally, copyright notices in open source software projects
have tended to follow a model similar to the following: Copyright
(C) 2001, 2004-2006 Company ABC.</p></li>
<li><p>Historical format typically includes one or more of the following,
in varying combinations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the word “Copyright”</p></li>
<li><p>the symbol “(C)” or ©</p></li>
<li><p>a year or series / range of years</p></li>
<li><p>the name of the individual or legal entity who is the copyright
holder</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Copyright 1998, Linus Torvalds</p></li>
<li><p>© 2003, 2010, Free Software Foundation, Inc.</p></li>
<li><p>Copyright (C) 2011, 2014-2019 Company ABC.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Newer Format:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In newer open source projects which have (or expect to have) many
different contributors, and where the contributors retain
ownership of their contributions, some projects express copyright
notices using a form similar to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Copyright Contributors to the ___________ Project.</p></li>
<li><p>Copyright The ___________ Contributors.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Newer format is intended to be a simple statement that the work is
copyrighted; that the contributors of the code licensed it, but
retain ownership of their copyrights; and that it was licensed for
distribution as part of the specified project.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Copyright The Kubernetes Authors.</p></li>
<li><p>Copyright Contributors to the OpenVDB Project.</p></li>

recommendations for how to express license notices using SPDX short-form
identifiers. REUSE also provides recommendations for how to express
copyright notices in a file. Their recommendations generally follow the
historical model, in that they require the inclusion of the names of the
copyright holders, and encourage the inclusion of year of publication.</p>
<p>In particular, REUSE also encourages the use of SPDX file tags for
copyright notices. SPDX file tags were added in version 2.2 of the SPDX
specification, and they provide a format for per-file information in a
single, easily searchable line, similar to SPDX short-form license
identifiers. REUSE recommends using these to express copyright notices
in files with the SPDX-FileCopyrightText: tag, as in the following
examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><p>If a file notice contains this information using an unambiguous
license reference, then this key information can be machine

improves the handling of compliance information. It also makes it
easier for those using open source software to understand the terms

<h3>Contributing to Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#contributing-to-projects" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>

to make sure it is ok for us to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>If we do not work for a company or organization, and are making the
contributions of code or content as an individual where we own the
copyright, it tends to be fairly straightforward. Projects have
individual contributor guidelines to follow and these should be read
carefully, any necessary paperwork filed or sign-offs prepared, and
then patches sent to the project.</p></li>
<li><p>If we do work for an organization, we will need to check with management that it is ok to send work you have been doing to the
upstream project. The company may need to sign some form of
contributor agreement or assign copyrights, or we may need to
provide DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) sign-offs, in order for
the contribution to be accepted.</p></li>
<li><p>If we are contributing code on behalf of employer — in other
words, code that is owned by employer and not by us — then we
should make sure employer will permit us to contribute it to
the project. Part of this may include employer’s acceptance of
the applicable contribution mechanism, such as signing a Contributor
License Agreement (CLA) or permitting a Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO) sign-off.</p></li>

<h4>Contribution Mechanisms<a class="headerlink" href="#contribution-mechanisms" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>To preserve a project’s goals, and to ensure that downstream users
can enjoy the rights granted by the projects license, the project
may require some formalities before it can accept changes from us.</p></li>
<li><p>Typically there will be some documentation in a CONTRIBUTING file in
the project repository, or on the project website and pages,
describing what formalities are needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Not all projects require these formalities. Many projects on GitHub
will accept pull requests without anything required other than a code
patch. However, many larger and significant open source projects use
formal contribution mechanisms to help protect the project community,
users and contributors, and their expectations.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of formal contribution mechanisms include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) e.g. Apache Software

<h4>Contributor License Agreements (CLAs)<a class="headerlink" href="#contributor-license-agreements-clas" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is an agreement between the
project and the owner of the contribution. As its name suggests, the
contributor grants a license to the project. The CLA’s text describes
the scope of the license that is granted.</p></li>
<li><p>This means that the owner of the contribution continues to own it.
Signing a CLA doesn’t mean that they transfer their ownership to the
project. Rather, the CLA grants a license, but the owner of the
contribution still owns its copyright, and can use and license it to
others in other ways.</p></li>
<li><p>Every project’s CLA might be different, and might grant a different
scope of license, have different requirements, etc. The scope of
licenses being granted to the project are often not the same as the
“outbound” license granted by the project to the rest of the world.
Because of this, we and/or legal team will likely want to
review closely any CLA before we sign it.</p></li>
<li><p>Many projects that use CLAs will have two different forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Individual: An Individual CLA (ICLA) is intended for individuals
who are contributing code that they own.</p></li>
<li><p>Corporate: A Corporate CLA (CCLA) is intended for companies and
organizations, where an employee is contributing code on behalf of
their employer.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If we are contributing code owned by employer, we should have
legal team review the Corporate CLA and, if they approve it,
have it signed by someone who is authorized by company to sign
contracts like CLAs. Do not bypass company’s review,
approval and signing of a CCLA by instead signing an Individual CLA
yourself, if the code is owned by, and being contributed on behalf
of employer.</p></li>

<section id="copyright-assignment">
<h4>Copyright Assignment<a class="headerlink" href="#copyright-assignment" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A Copyright Assignment agreement, like a CLA, is also an agreement
between the project and the owner of the contribution. However,
unlike CLAs, a Copyright Assignment actually transfers (or “assigns”)
ownership of the copyright from the contributor to the project. The
contributor will no longer own the copyright in the contributed code.</p></li>
<li><p>Copyright assignment is typically used by projects that want to own
the copyrights for enforcement purposes, and to retain the right to
relicense a project at some future date. (CLAs may also enable
relicensing of a project, depending on the text of the particular
CLA.)</p></li>
<li><p>A common example where this is used is by the Free Software
Foundation, or FSF, for contributions to the GNU compiler. Here they
ask for the copyright to be assigned as one contribution mechanism
before they accept changes in, so that the project will own all
copyrights in the contributions.</p></li>
<li><p>In the DCO, the contributor indicates at the time they submit a
contribution — via a sign-off statement in the metadata provided
together with the contribution — that they have the right to submit
the change under the indicated license, have it be public, and if it
is based on a previous work, that too is ok to submit, to the best of

<p>The DCO does not involve getting a signed agreement (whether from us or
employer). Instead, if we are submitting to a project that uses a
DCO, we will be adding a “signed-off” statement in patch.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A signed-off statement follows the following syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>A “Signed-off-by:” tag followed by the person’s name and email
address. This statement can easily be added to commit with a
single <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-s</span></code> command-line flag when using the Git tools.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Some tools make it easier to enforce DCO checks, meaning that they
help ensure that patches submitted for inclusion are only
incorporated into the project code if they were accompanied by a

document the results, and help identify where information is lacking or
is poorly documented.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, FOSSology is a scanner that can work on individual files
as well as entire projects, performing operations on every file in the
source archive. There are several types of scans that can be done, each
of which has an associated scanner application.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Nomos: Nomos searches for licenses using regular expression matching,
combining with context identification, i.e. does a certain phrase
occur in the vicinity of another certain phrase? Nomos will return
strings such as GPL or MIT, but generally not give the specific
version of a license. It can also detect an unknown license and
report that.</p></li>
<li><p>Monk: Monk also does text-based searching and can report back on
license variations, such as GPL-2 and GPL-3+, etc. It cannot
recognize unknown licenses, as it works off of a stored table in the
server. Monk is complementary to Nomos.</p></li>
<li><p>Copyrights: Copyrights are investigated by searching for “copyright”
and “(C)” in the text. Less ex plicit assignments such as phrases
like “written by” are also evaluated. Users can examine the reported
results and decide on the correct answers (including no explicit
copyright).</p></li>
<li><p>Export Control Codes (ECC) are also determined by regular expression
searching (this is also called export control and customs codes).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The FOSSology interface is designed to let the user evaluate all the
results found, and correct or investigate further. If software is well
designed with respect to explicit statements of copyrights, licenses,
authorship, export controls, etc., then the tools will have a much
easier time. Thus, software design that considers these issues from the
start will breeze through a FOSSology scan.</p>

<h3>Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)<a class="headerlink" href="#software-package-data-exchange-spdx" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://spdx.org/">Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)</a> open
standard provides a common format for sharing data about software
copyrights, licenses, security information, etc. This open standard is
used to communicate software bill of material information. By its very
nature, this avoids repetition of work and streamlines compliance.</p>
<section id="spdx-file">
<h4>SPDX File<a class="headerlink" href="#spdx-file" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>A project will include an SPDX file that consists of a series of tags
and values, separated by a colon and space (there are other possible
formats but this is the simplest one).</p>

such as Apache-2.0, or GPL-2.0-only or GPL-3.0-or-later. These are
convenient for inclusion in source files, without a rather long list of
lines describing the license.</p>

<h3>Community Health Analytics Open Source Software (CHAOSS)<a class="headerlink" href="#community-health-analytics-open-source-software-chaoss" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://chaoss.community/">Community Health Analytics Open Source Software
(CHAOSS)</a> project purpose is to develop
tools and metrics for evaluation of the health of open source projects
and ecosystems, with a view to increasing sustainability over time. This
is important for stakeholders making good, informed decisions about how
to be involved.</p>
<p>The goals are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Establish excellent metrics for measuring community activity,
contributions, and health</p></li>
<li><p>Produce software tooling or doing the analysis</p></li>
<li><p>Build project health reports.</p></li>

<h3>Automated Compliance Tooling<a class="headerlink" href="#automated-compliance-tooling" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Automated Compliance Tooling has four constituent projects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>FOSSology runs license, copyright and export control scans, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>SPDX tools construct and communicate software bills of material.</p></li>
<li><p>Quartermaster (QMSTR) is integrated into the product build system
itself, rather than be a separate “final” step. Thus, it is
DevOps-oriented and it facilitates Continuous Integration and
Development methods. QMSTR was contributed by its initiator,
Endocode.</p></li>
<li><p>TERN inspects package metadata in container images, and elucidates
the bill of materials. With the growing adoption of containerized
deployments, demystifying their contents and examining their
compliance become of increased importance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The word “automated” in the ACT name is important. Having a smooth
workflow with compliance evaluation built into the work flow end-to-end
can only lead to speedier and more confident development and deployment,
and integration with CI/CD methods.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Leadership vs Control and Why Projects Fail<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-leadership-vs-control-and-why-projects-fail" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>How an open source software project is led has important consequences
for its growth, longevity and capability. Good leadership empowers
contributors to do their best work. It also leads to a more efficient
and rapid development process. Building trust is important, as is making
sure experienced project members can mentor less experienced ones and
train subsystem maintainers.</p>
<section id="leading-vs-controlling-a-project">
<h3>Leading vs Controlling a Project<a class="headerlink" href="#leading-vs-controlling-a-project" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Loosen the Chains: A good leader listens. Good ideas can originate
from many different contributors, even recent entrants into a
project.</p></li>
<li><p>Mentoring: Proper mentoring empowers people, leads to a more
efficient workflow, and contributes to long term vitality and growth
of a project.</p></li>
<li><p>Building Trust: Without trust, an open source project cannot function</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contributors must trust that their submissions will be treated
with respect and given reasonably prompt consideration.</p></li>
<li><p>Project leaders must trust that subsystem maintainers are
qualified and capable of doing their job. And if they are not
living up to their responsibilities, they can be tutored on doing
a better job or be asked to transition out of the role.</p></li>

<section id="why-do-many-oss-projects-fail">
<h3>Why Do Many OSS Projects Fail?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-do-many-oss-projects-fail" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The vast majority of OSS projects do not succeed. The reasons are
varied, but include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Insufficient interest: Competition from more established projects
that duplicate the intended functionality, even if the new project
seems to have features the older one does not.</p></li>
<li><p>Poor leadership. This can mean a lack of attention and prompt
response, as well as antisocial behavior or autocratic rule, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Not enough developers</p></li>
<li><p>Insufficient funding. Serious projects often require developers who
have employers that see the work as relevant to their mission at
best, or at worst, do not disparage contributing as either a time
waster or potential intellectual property leak.</p></li>
<li><p>Insufficient or uninformed attention to licensing issues that
alienate contributors who are wary of either giving their code to
others without adequate protections or compensation.</p></li>

<h3>Introduction to Respecting and Encouraging Diversity in OSS<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-respecting-and-encouraging-diversity-in-oss" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Diversity in an OSS project can mean many different things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Race and national origin</p></li>
<li><p>Sex and gender identity</p></li>
<li><p>National and geographical/regional characteristics, including both
language and cultural differences</p></li>
<li><p>Religious beliefs and political views</p></li>
<li><p>Acceptance of different opinions and methods about how the project
should take shape and develop in the future.</p></li>
